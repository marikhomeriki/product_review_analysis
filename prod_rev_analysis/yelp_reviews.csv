0,"Hundreds of happy customers come through every hour.  Don't let the outdoor queue scare you off as it did me last night but I came back for lunch today and the line, albeit the length of the restaurant, only took 20 minutes or less.  All the employees were very courteous and pleasant.The chicken ruby was just amazing and very complex. There was not a drop left. The paneer tikka is probably meant to be shared  and was a bit underwhelming.  We got a downstairs table near the bar and dishwasher so it was terribly noisy with all the silverware.  But, it was also indicative just how popular this place is.",5.0
1,"We came for breakfast on a Monday so we were able to bypass the usual line. If coming for dinner, I would definitely recommend making reservations.I had the pancakes and bacon naan for breakfast. Both were delicious. Despite the toffee sauce, the pancakes weren't overly sweet. The bacon naan has a nice tomato jam to help balance the bacon.Apparently the chai is bottomless and I missed the memo l until we were cashing out. Lesson learned.The kitchen downstairs smells incredible so I'll definitely be checking them out for dinner another day.",4.0
2,"Have been wanting to go to Dishoom for years and I was glad it conveniently fit into my morning schedule. I passed it several times in the days before in the afternoons and the line gets insanely long for dinner time. I walked in and got seated with ease.The store itself is absolutely stunning. The area is huge. Even going downstairs to use the bathroom is like a different experience. I came around 9am during their breakfast menu, which I didn't know about. Guess I have to come back during later meals to try their other items.I got the keema per eedu. It was super flavorful and rich. Maybe I got too excited and scarfed it down too fast. It put me in a huge food coma. The liver, egg, and savory flavors felt heavy. It was an explosion in your mouth. I washed this down with chai and a cappuccino. The service was prompt. The store was scattered with some people out for leisure and business meals. There was always a consistent amount of people filling the shop throughout my meal. Gotta come back to try their regular menu--likely when I have more time in London!",4.0
3,"The best Indian food in London!This is my 3rd visit to London and Dishoom, the quality of food hasn't changed and it's still the best Indian food in town",5.0
4,"4.5/5 stars As someone who isn't well versed in Indian food, the menu can be overwhelming. Our waiter was kind enough to explain that the dishes were meant to be shared, and he made recommendations for what dishes would be good. We got a few small plates: the Pau Bhaji (Mashed vegetables with buns) and the lamb samosa. Both of these were excellent. The lamb samosa was so crispy, hot, and flavorful. The Pau Bhaji was new for me. The bun was so fluffy and buttery and was perfect with the mashed vegetables. It just tasted like a herb/spice sauce.For our main entrees, we got the chicken berry biryani (chicken and rice dish) and the mutton pepper fry (curry dish) and added the raita (yogurt sauce). The chicken biryani was quite good, and the chicken was pretty tender. The raita was supposed to be used with the biryani, but it kinda made the dish too cold for my liking. The mutton pepper fry was tender and flavorful! It was spicy, but I was surprisingly able to tolerate it. We ordered garlic naan, which was perfect for scooping all the sauce. It didn't have a strong garlic flavor, and it wasn't piping hot. We also ordered the chili broccoli salad, which was divine! The combination of pistachios, seeds, and dates made the broccoli so tasty! Overall, I enjoyed our meal here and loved trying new foods! We came around 5:15 pm and didn't need to wait for a table, but when we left the restaurant, there was a huge line, so definitely try to go during off peak hours.",5.0
5,"I'm sure there's not much more I could say because Dishoom is so famous and popular, but if it's any indication, we went for breakfast then went BACK for lunch on the same day. Everyone told us this restaurant is amazing and it very much lived up to the hype. Every dish was a revelation, especially the dal. I especially appreciated the kids menu. The staff was so lovely to my four-year-old child. Just perfect. I can't wait to eat here again.",5.0
6,"Food 5/5Ambiance 5/5Service 5/5You'll likely have to wait anywhere from 30 minutes to an hour for a table depending on the timing and your group size, but it's well worth it. They will sometimes pass out drinks to those waiting in line which is a nice touch. The food is stellar, though a bit different from your typical Indian restaurant in that it's more of a small plates style. Since portions are smaller, they recommend at least 2-3 plates per person here. My favorite was the Dishoom House Chaat, a dish that was recommended by our waiter. Note that unlike other Indian restaurants, they don't ask you for a preferred spice level on their dishes, so if you're particularly sensitive to spice, ask your waiter for specific recommendations. Ambiance is lively and there are neat booths downstairs where you can control the music level and (if I remember correctly) the fan as well- something I haven't seen at another restaurant. Bathrooms are also quite nice and clean- something that is always hugely appreciated in a big city like London. I will be making this a regular spot for anytime I'm in London!",5.0
7,"It is a chain restaurant but nothing about it lacks the quality. This place is incredible and they need to come to the States! Its Indian cuisines and its has a wide array of options. I feel like this is perfect for people that might be intimidated by Indian food and want to try it for the first time. Theres so much great choices for various diets: vegetarians, vegans, carnivores, etc. My partner is a vegan and she was pleased with all the options. I went with the Ruby Chicken which is essentially a tika masala chicken. Run don't walk to get it. Very delicious and the sauce with some basmati rice is outstanding. The samosas are a great appetizer as well. The gunpowder potatoes was a great side. Never had potatoes that seasoned before.Disroom please please please make your way to New York. They longing for a restaurant like this.",5.0
8,"Wow wow wow.. A very memorable experience and service provided by ALEX at this location on 3rd of November. Alex was attentive and charming, he made sure that my friends and I were well taken care of for the evening. I happen to have a mango allergy but the manager was able to resolve that issue quickly with a special menu that was checked off by the chef with all the dishes that did not have Mango in it. I was grateful and very appreciative of such wonderful gesture and hope the restaurant continues to provide this caliber of service in our future visits. Marvelous time spent and would highly recommend this location to anyone who is visiting London. Thank you Alex!Food was also absolutely delicious, dare I say some of the best Indian cuisine I've had so far? Make reservations if you can to avoid the long long line outside.",5.0
9,"After having owned the cookbook from Dishoom for a while, I was really excited to try the dishes straight from the origin. I made a reservation for one during lunch hours on a long layover I had in London. A reservation is definitely recommended, by the time I was leaving, there was a line outside. As soon as I walked into the restaurant, I was taken by the gorgeous interiors. You can tell that the decor was carefully picked out and the detailing of every element of the restaurant was beautiful. It's a lovely ambiance to have a meal in. When I sat down, they handed me this cute paper menu that looked like a newspaper. Since I was dining alone, I asked the waitress for her best recommendations. She gave me several options from the small plates, entrees, and breads/rices. I started with the house chai. Then I chose a small plate--the okra fries, an entree--the lamb chops, and a garlic naan to go with it. The chai came out first and that was so delicious; I had 3 glasses (btw, they refill the chai for free!). Then came the okra fries and wow. That was one of the best preparations of okra I've ever tasted. Then my lamb chops and garlic naan came, and if you come here, you HAVE to try the lamb chops. They were cooked to perfection and extremely delicious. The garlic naan I probably could have done without with this dish, it was a bit thin and less fluffy than I was expecting. Overall, I absolutely loved this restaurant. It is a place not to be missed. I look forward to coming back in the future to try more of their dishes.",5.0
10,"Came here for an early lunch when passing through the UK a while back and wow...the best indian food I have eaten out at a restaurant!! I generally don't eat indian food out because my parents are amazing cooks and we can enjoy good food from the comfort of our home most times. Before I came to the UK, numerous people raved about Dishoom telling me it was a must go!We had a quick stopover in the UK and made it a priority to come here! One thing to note is that they have breakfast hours where they serve a completely different menu from the regular lunch/dinner food. We had showed up early and they were still serving brunch. Call and check this in advance because we ended up waiting over an hour in the restaurant to get lunch food! Nonetheless, the wait was worth it!The ambiance of this spot it really pleasant and unique. We were treated so wonderfully by the staff and service was quite quick once lunch opened. We ordered a few different entrees -- chili chicken, chicken, daal, chicken tikka, and naan. We also got a mango lassi and rice on the side. The food was amazing! Flavors were solid, and meat was tender. I highly recommend all the dishes we ordered because I would 100% order them all again.",5.0
11,The food was sooo amazing I forgot to take pictures before I ate it all. Dishoom is an absolute must if you are in london. Make sure you make a reservation or else you will have a wait!!! The ambiance is so nice and the staff is super attentive. The Ruby chicken was amazing. The tandoori chicken was juicy with just the right amount of charcoal grill. The garlic naan was perfect to dip in the sauce. Ugh- I will forever dream about this meal!!!,5.0
12,"This was a stop during our first trip to London. The food was worth the hype for us. We had the uttapam pancakes with Shrikhand, chicken ruby, cheese toast, jackfruit biryani, and the chicken tikka roll. The breakfast menu wasn't our thing but lunch was absolutely delicious. The chicken was perfectly cooked, the service was excellent, and the ambience was perfect for brunch. I would return.",5.0
13,The line is always so long here--so get here early. I got in at 6pm on a Friday and waited for about an hour.The food here is amazing! Especially the daal! It's so rich and creamy. The ruby chicken and the vegetable dish that came with buns were great too!It's absolutely worth the wait,5.0
14,"I had to come back to Dishoom. The wait was about 45mins and and they were so kind to be handing out chai and wine. Our waiter was so nice and explained the menu. The food was sooo good! The naan was extra soft. The drinks were strong, as they should be  I will definitely be coming back. This location is convenient and close to bars/pubs and the theater.",5.0
15,"On a visit to London, we stopped by Dishoom as it was highly recommended on the internet.  They have indoor and outdoor seating as of this review, and also free wifi.  The restaurant has two levels, and has gorgeous decor.  We were able to walk in and get seated immediately on a Friday late afternoon.We had the mango lassi:  nice yogurty mango drink.  Not too sweet, and topped with fennel seeds.  Not sure what the fennel seeds were for except decoration as it wasn't very edible.  Still very good, 4/5  Basmati rice: a bit dry but still edible.   3/5Chicken berry britannia: oddly has cranberries in it.  Lots of chicken in it. 4.5/5Chicken ruby:  creamy and rich with a nice hint of ginger.  4.5/5Garlic naan: thin and crispy, dotted with lots of fresh garlic and made by hand.  Highly recommend! 5/5Lamb samosas: wish they were bigger; they were tiny!  Thin crispy outer layer.  4.5/5All in all, this place was pretty packed for a reason.  Great comfort food, very salty though.",5.0

17,"Finally tried the famous Dishoom on a recent trip to London. I was prepared for a long line for dinner and I think in total it took about 45 minutes for my party of 1. While in line the passed out samples of their chai which was a great way to get ready for the meal. I was seated in the back courtyard which was perfect though I will say the action seems to be downstairs with hustle and bustle. For my meal I got the vegetable samosas (phenomenal!), garlic naan, and the chicken ruby. There were so many options to choose from I would've liked to split a few things with friends to really get a sampling. Overall a nice experience!",4.0
18,"Heard many raving reviews about this place and had to wait 30 mins to get a spot; it was solid but maybe didn't quite live up to the hype.The waiter recommended we each pick 3 items. I got the murgh malai, roomali roti, and kachumber. The chicken was tender and flavorful, and the roti was warm and yummy.Overall a solid choice!",4.0
19,"Allergy friendly restaurant - They went above and beyond to accommodate our allergies and dietary restrictions. There's a separate vegan menu. I received a binder of allergen matrix (excel sheets) to cross reference against allergens and menu items. The chef also marked up a menu for me, crossing out and checking off items that I can(not) have. I wish every place was like this! Our server was also patient and amazing! House chai - Subtly sweet with a strong ginger taste. Love it! My friend tried mine and ended up getting her own for dessert. Chicken ruby with garlic naan - Similar to butter chicken and absolutely delicious! There's a lot of chicken for the small dish. Garlic naan wasn't anything special, could be more garlicky. Murgh Malai - Perfectly seasoned and tender chicken dish but not particularly special. Chicken Berry Britannia - Delicious and definitely would get again!Chef's Covent Garden Special: Tila-Foi's Very Best Masala Fish - Very spicy, and too spicy for me, so it's hard to tell if it's good. Dishoom House Chaat - Delicious! Kind of get the flavors of a Vietnamese Spring Roll. Roti - Nothing specialMango kulfi - Disappointing in presentation. It's just a mango popsicle on a chopstick in a glass cup. Kala Khatta Gola Ice - Very strong on the spice side rather than sweetness. It was not a favorite. We had reservations for a party of 6, booked 1-2 months ahead. We noticed the non-reservation line was down the street!",5.0
