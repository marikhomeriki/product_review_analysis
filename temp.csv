0,"I have today switched accounts as the Customer Service telephone waiting time with this bank is abysmal.    I want to close a savings account.  Tried online chat but was told I have to call and speak to an advisor.   Yet another 40 minute wait.   Thank Goodness this is the last I have anything to do with banking with this bank.   Goodbye HSBC.   Never, ever again will I use you to bank with.",1
1,"Just trying to activate a credit card. As advised in the accompanying letter l tried downloading the app, but it asked me for my telephone security code. As l am a new customer and do not have a current account l do not have a telephone security code. So can't do that. Then tried ringing the phone number to activate the card only to be informed that the service is unavailable. Was put on hold waiting to speak to someone and eventually gave up.Apparently in order to use the app you first have to sign up for telephone banking and to sign up for that you have to visit a branch. Ridiculous.",1
2,Bad and getting worse! Absolutely everything is being directed to the app. Trying to speak to someone is neigh on impossible. When you do eventually get hold of a representative they fail to action any promises made! What’s more they don’t care - asked to review service received now on 3 occasions and despite scoring the lowest possible score and stating why nobody has ever followed up. Useless!,1
3,If I could give 0 stars I would. The customer service team is unknowledgeable and incapable of performing any tasks. Each person I speak to tells me something different. They have caused me major stress and anxiety. AVOID this bank at all costs.,1
4,"Had a phone banking about transaction failed, they just keep transferring the call to Fraud dept and customer representative back and forth and not ready to register any complaint even after 150 mins. completely fed up with service and dont know",1
5,"Really shabby service.  We are a US business considering opening a UK bank account for our UK subsidiary.  Wasted time on an online chat, eventually their support person booked a slot with a supposed business specialist.  The specialist emailed us 2 weeks later to say that we needed another specialist.  HSBC have said that they can't open new accounts because of Brexit.  Their adverts say, ""Opportunity without Borders"", their staff effectively say, ""HSBC in the UK is closed for business"".  Avoid at all costs!  You can't get to speak to anyone useful for 2+ weeks so look elsewhere if you value speed in business or prompt customer service.",1
6,"I found an outgoing transaction of a big amount in my bank account, I am worried to death as I don't remember to set that up. Tried to ring several times and wasted my entire morning but haven't been able to speak to customer service agent. All they offer is useless AI.Totally disappointed with the poor service",1
7,"I have been with this bank since the MIdland days and have to say in recent years the service is incredibly poor. Everything is pushed towards the mobile app and if you want to actually speak to a person or use any other means of accessing your money, it is made increasingly difficult. If you raise your concerns with any member of staff you are just pushed to the ever long call queue to fix things you never even caused in the first place.I've given too many opportunities for HSBC to prove me wrong and unfortunately now I feel it is time to move all accounts elsewhere.",1
8,"Tried to get new current account due to data breach. Queued for half an hour, two secure chats, on holdbefore gave up after 26mins to telephone banking. Couldn’t solve a major fraud risk, I work in a high risk industry. I’m supposedly a premier customer so who knows how they treat everybody else. I’m actually at a complete loss now. Can’t believe how bad customer service is. I asked to raise formal complaint in secure chat and they ignored the request! You couldn’t make it up.",1
9,"Set up a Global account to send money to the USA. The destination details were correct but the money was returned (minus a fee) and the transaction failed. Chat couldn’t answer international questions, wasted 32mins waiting to speak to an agent - gave up. Went to my local branch (closes next year), only advice came over the counter as there was nobody available to speak to me. Have banked with HSBC for many years without a problem. What’s happened to the bank, reading recent reviews sounds like it’s in freefall.",1
10,"TAKING INTERNATIONAL CHARGES YET NEVER USED MY CARD ABROAD, IM HIS DAD AND HES BEEN RIPPED OFF CONTINUALY, THEY HAVE BLAMED COVID, YET THEY WILL NOT PAY HIS MONEY BACK, HES HAD 3 YEARS OF LIES",1
11,"Avoid at all costs! Shocking bank, logged in one day to find my account blocked! Called to find out why and they didn’t give me a reason they just kept saying it’s “under review” well I’d like to know the reason your withholding my money, they have failed to give me a time frame as well leaving me with no money.If you like your money getting stolen and account blocked then you’ll love this bank!!",1
12,1 star is too many for this feedback. My 97 year old mother requires a new cheque book. She does not have online banking. She has spent over a period of 3 calls to the HSBC over 3 hours waiting for an Agent to speak to her and deal with the request. She passed the security voice check and her request was recognised so why did she need to speak to an agent when this could have been dealt with by the automated HSBC system. My mother now intends to change to a more helpful bank.,1
13,"Terrible! I walked in and the woman working there rudely said ""what do you want"". I suffer with autism and was stugglin to talk and she laughed at me. Said i was dumb. called me fat. and was racist to me",1
14,"After over 25yrs with HSBC I received a letter informing me that they are closing my account! No reason why, nothing! Disgusting service, they call themselves a global bank and now with all the latest financial problems they pull the rug from me. I guess customer loyalty counts for nothing! Shame on you",2
15,"What has happened to this bank?Absolutely awful, quite obvious the person on the mortgage help desk was not interested… and they get paid!!!!!Come on get decent people like it used to be.",1
16,"Applied for an account (had one in the past ) i have no financial problems at allSent all the documentation they asked for, however no reply.Have rang helpline three times and been into branch twice and still waiting",1
17,"Massive waste of time. Trying to register for online banking, with every detail sent in separate letters and taking forever to arrive.Called up to find out what my Telephone Security Code is, waited over 30 mins, only to be told it can take over 7 working days to arrive by post.Utterly backwards bank. I'll be switching away from them as soon as possible.",1
18,Worse than useless. No information whatsoever on the business website regarding what you can do re a forgotten pin number for business debit card. Nothing telling you what number to call in this situation or if you can view it via online banking (which I have tried and can find nothing there either). Nothing in FAQ's for this scenario. Just utterly useless.,1
19,"Reported fraudulent use of credit card for GBP22,30 by letter and HSBC sent message on internet banking that I should call them as they claimed to have phoned me but had not. When I phoned them I was kept waiting 30 minutes and when I got through the agent didn't know what information was required and tried to put me through to the fraud department - I waited another 15 minutes and gave up. The matter is still not resolved. HSBC owes me 22.30 GBP!",1
20,"I will be closing my account with HSBC, although I was a customer for many years. Unfortunately they don't have a way to submit a complaint, as of course they don't want to deal with big amounts of disappointed customers.I am abroad and I spent a lot of money calling HSBC and not getting any help or solution on my blocked account via mobile application, neither access to my own money in my account. I understand that the system is made for security purposes. However somehow hackers still hack into the accounts, but regular people can not pass your security questions or remember if they made any transactions in September in order to pass their verification process. There should be an easier way to solve the situation if the account is blocked by mistake. Without spending lots of money for being on the line, where no one is picking up the phone. Please find some more people for your customer service!",1
21,bad service before and getting worse. hopeless don't use hsbc. as they now seem to be going all online I would suggest they buck their ideas up!,1
22,Like so many others tried to open  account and switch after falling for Martin  Lewis scam to claim £200. Ha ha it seems they deliberately slow down the process in order to go beyond 30days. Dishonest and misleading and shame on Martin Lewis for continuing to recommend HSBC,1
23,"HSBC Chairman, CEO & the complete Board of Directors are to RESIGN . . . Hopefully.They are to close yet more UK Branches (another 114 to go) Share Price is down, further reductions in HSBC Branch, Support & IT Staff etc, selling-off more Bank business assets, the call wait times to Call Centres are horrendous - need I go on?All this is happening on your watch - HANG YOUR HEADS IN SHAME.",1
24,"Significant deterioration of customer service. The bot is useless, the round the clock service is no longer there.My online banking was suspended. I have a message to call a number but the bot is so useless and I am told to call back during office hours.I will be closing my account at the first available opportunity after banking with hsbc for 25 yrs. You have allowed your service to deteriorate significantly with no care about your customer and I no longer trust such a company with my funds.",1
25,"My wife has opened or at least tried to open an account but never received full documentation and therefore ability to use online banking so therefore cannot transfer initial money into the account. Despite advising this on more than one occasion, she rang them again yesterday and they said the documentation was in the post and would receive today but they would telephone at 3pm today to confirm she had received, no phone call and no documentation, pointless ringing them as waiting 40mins plus to talk to them.",1
26,"What a pathetic attempt at customer service this bank offers, first they contract out their customer services to India who let's be honest my dog has a better grasp of the English language.Now it takes on average 20/30 minutes to talk to somebody.The recent press release of hundreds of UK branches today just goes to show the agenda they have of getting rid of any human connection and replacing with faceless online services.Profit before customers, I would advise all current employee's to jump ship as you ain't worth a damn in there eyes.",1
27,HSBC is to close its branches in Cromer and Fakenham they are bloody useless as LLOYDS BANK is keeping its branches open in the town! THE MIDLAND BANK would never have done this they were the Listening Bank while HSBC is a Pathetic bank so go ahead join LLOYDS BANK!,1
28,"Be warned, HSBC Customer support continues to deteriorate. They used to have a good online chat help service, but it has now been replaced by a useless bot, which - despite you already being online - suggests you log on via your phone. Then, after failing to help you, closes the conversation with no option to speak to a human.",3
29,"With recent branch closers and more to come, it raises the question whether HSBC wants to continue as a retail bank. I now have a 60 mile round trip if I want to access more than £500 of my money in cash. I simply don't have that kind of time available to me. Combine that with a sub-par digital product, it begs the question what is the point of HSBC as a retail bank? Clearly they don't care about product and customers. Time to close account and switch to Monzo who have a much better, more innovative digital product.",1
30,Calling the customer service to speak to an agent is impossible. The waiting times are incredibly long.  It beggars believe that after waiting more than 40 still no one is answering. Their automated system is ridiculous.   HSBC have the Worst Customer Service. Utter rubbish!,1
31,I see so many negative reviews on here but today a lovely gentleman called Prasad helped me to get back into my online banking. As I am useless with technology over 50 I struggle. However prasad was a shining example of patience understanding and very polite even when I got frustrated he understood and was amazing thank you so much prasad x,5
32,"We visited Tavern street today (as Felixstowe & Woodbridge branches have both closed sadly) and had excellent service from Wendy - she was kind, responsive and professional. Thank you Wendy!",4
33,"Worst service, called them and explained my situation, they then put me through to another department, waited for 10 minutes then they hung up on me. Tried again to call then and waited for 30 minutes, still they wouldn't answer. Worst service ever",1
34,"Unbelievable what I have to go through, I am a victim of a fraud that happened to me this year. This fake online trading scam skinned me for 89,000 pounds and it all went to their hsbc branch in hong kong. The level of service and customer support is shocking after suffering such a loss and to your own bank that is operating offshore. How can you let these criminals operate? Luckily I got some help and I am progressing legally with them as we speak, but if it was not for the help I got I would be done. Shame on this bank for letting criminals operate.",1
35,"I've been a customer for 20 years, since 2002. Last time I called support was around 5 years ago. It was excellent as it used to be, even the chat was good, and they were able to help through it. Now the chat is useless and calling, well, like many others commenting here, 1 hour waiting for picking up and the call just dropped. They outsourced the customer service to a call center somewhere, quality dropped to the bottom like many other things outsourced. Tried to open a savings account and it says I'm not a UK resident which is false. This prompted to have to call them and go through this experience. Time to look for another bank.",1
36,"After 30 years working and banking with them I’ve reached the end of my tether. Godawful bank and service. Can’t even get hold of my own money without talking to fraud for an hour on a daily basis. Dreadful bank, don’t touch them.",1
37,Just appalling wait times for business banking telephone advice.  Conflicting advice from the branch and the telephone service.  And their internet banking system still has manual forms to fill in that must get put in someone's in tray.   Pick a different bank.,1
38,"after waiting on phone for near a hour the assitant who struggled to understand english then decided enough was enough and terminated the call. Not Before refusing me a chance to speak to a supervisor and asking me a rediculous security question "" you spent £3.50 nearly 3 weeks ago can you tell me where""Unbelievable.Noel Quinn CEO you have been warned.",1
39,"Sent me a Credit card for 0% balance transfers, problem was by the time it took this bank to sort codes out and all that rubbish, my 0% balance transfer promo had expired, OMG its laughable.....I use my card now for a back scratcher :)",1
