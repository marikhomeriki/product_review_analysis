0,The best food & service of our day. The mushroom & ale pie along with the apple & blackberry crumble with custard - beyond delish. Service was amazing! Cute area - great people watching,5 
1,"We are Californians in London for the first time. We stopped here and we're helped and served by the cutest women. We weren't sure what to order so they filled us in on the popular choices. They were spot on and we loved the champ potatoes and 2 sausages. Then had dessert, the sticky toffee and custard sauce was  just what the doctor ordered. We added a scoop of ice cream but wished we hadn't it was perfect without. It was the perfect filling and warming meal for a cool London day. Sorry no pics we were halfway through when I thought about it.",5 
2,"Don't trust the listed hours! Mother Mash closes when it wants to, regardless of any times posted online. We were staying near Buckingham Palace, and decided to walk to the nearest Mother Mash, a twenty-five minute walk. We didn't think anything of it, considering on their website it says that they close at 10 PM. We arrived around 8:00 PM. We walked in and a man with his hand outstretched comes toward us, and we start to back out as he comes closer. He all but pushes us out the door stating, ""We're closed, bruv!""We were shocked. Imagine walking all that way for something specific, to be turned away so rudely. We had had a fine experience at another location and had been looking forward to having Mother Mash as our last meal in the city. We ended up having Chinese food. Not ideal.What a shame.",1 
3,"Arrived 6pm and after waiting a considerable time for service at the door, they rudely turned me away saying they were full despite only seeing 2 tables with people. I requested take out but was refused any service and was quickly shoo'd out the door. Very saddening and disappointed experience.",1 
4,"Tucked away in Soho along a street of other eateries, Mother Mash was open on a rainy Sunday evening.  I always want to try the local dishes while I'm traveling so this was a perfect opportunity to try some bangers and mash (a traditional British dish, consisting of sausages served with mashed potatoes) before we headed back home.  Surprisingly, it was quiet and we were able to be seated right away.  The space is small, but has a handful of seats inside and outside.  The toilet, along with the kitchen is downstairs.Menu is straightforward.  You pick your mash, your sausage, and type of gravy. I went with the cheesy mash, Lincolnshire sausage, and traditional gravy. It wasn't before long that our dishes came out.  The mashed potatoes were a bit thick and gummy - and honestly I kind of like them that way.  However, it's a sign that the potatoes have been overworked and too much starch was released.  Not sure if that's how it's normally served, BUT again, I like them that way.  The sausage was nice and flavorful and paired nicely with my gravy.  They did mix up my gravy with my husband's though, but that worked out in my favor, lol. Go for the caramelized onion gravy as the traditional gravy didn't have as much flavor.For dessert I ordered the sticky toffee pudding for takeaway and shared it with my family back home.  It was delish, but what made it even more tasty was adding a scoop of caramel ice cream.  Yum!Overall, good spot to try some traditional British dishes if you're nearby.",4 
5,"First meal in London and knew I had to try bangers and mash so we made a stop by here while exploring Soho! Basically you can choose your type of mash, sausage (or pie) and gravy. I had the champ mash which came with green onions, mother plucker sausage which was flavoured with sundried tomatoes, all topped with a farmer's sauce (red wine sauce with bacon). The mash was so creamy but the green onions cut the heaviness. The sausage reminded me a bit of the Chinese sausage in hot rice bowls. The best part though was the gravy.. didn't leave a drop of it on my plate. Such a delicious comforting food! I ordered the ginger beer for my drink which was so yummy as well. Definitely recommend visiting here to try the bangers and mash!!",5 
6,"We came here at around 6 pm but the place was packed, so we decided to come back at 8 pm to have dessert.  The best sticky toffee pudding, it's definitely lived up to its reputation! We ordered a few desserts and all came with two scoops of ice cream.1.  Sticky toffee pudding - very tasty & flavorful 2.  Ginger bread pudding - lots of ginger flavor3.  Saucy chocolate - if you're a chocolate lover, this one is for you!4.  Apple Crumbl pie - this was ok",4 
7,Perfect comfort food meal! Sausages were nicely seasoned. Mashed potatoes were creamy and buttery. The meat pie had a good crispy outer layer and the filling was hardy. Everything we ordered including the side dishes were good. Highly recommend if you're looking for a warm and satisfying meal!,5 
8,"Omg! If you are in London, you have got to eat here! they have a simple menu, but the food is so delicious!! You choose a type of mashed potato you want, either a sausage or pie and a gravy to put on top. We picked the sausage option and it comes with 2-we got to try two different flavors plus ordered two extra sausages to try out the other flavors. One plate was enough for two people and we left satisfied. All sausages we tried were great! They also give you extra gravy if you need more-free of charge. It's great comfort food that won't leave your pockets empty. What we enjoyed in this place was the great customer service as well. The woman who served us was so nice and friendly, and also attentive. That is always so appreciated! This place hit the spot- added plus was the great service! Would recommend this place to anyone looking to eat great comfort food in London!",5 
9,"We had to try Bangers and Mash while visiting The Big Smoke so we Yelped it and found Mother Mash to be top rated for this dish. This place specializes in Bangers & Mash and they do a great job. My Vegan daughter had a delicious vegan take on this classic while I had the original. You get to choose your type of mash, main (banger) and then gravy. You can also have it in a pie form. It's very customizable. We added a side of Mushy Peas and Cheesy Cauliflower. The dishes were very filling and we left there stuffed.We felt bad for the waitress as apparently the kitchen is downstairs and she has to go up and down stairs for every dish. They need a dumbwaiter there. Overall, great food in a very popular and busy location. Great to try!",5 
10,"Was desperately craving authentic British meat pies and thankfully found this place relatively close to our hotel! We got in without a reservation right at opening time but sadly they were out of both the Bubble and Squeak mash AND the steak and Guinness stout pie. No matter, the minced beef pie with champ mash and traditional gravy was still very delicious! Prices are reasonable and the food was satisfying. We would definitely return again to try the other pies on our next trip back to London!",5 
11,"Lovely. My husband and I got to spend 5 beautiful (kid free!) days in London. We got in, I believe it was Saturday, around lunch time with no wait. The waitress was lovely and very helpful. I had the steak pie with Irish mash and onion gravy. As an American this was very different for me, but I loved it!! My husband enjoyed his chipotle chicken sausage, Irish mash, with onion gravy. At the end of the meal an older gentleman took our payment and recommended we see Fortnum and Mason, which we ended up enjoying very much and most likely wouldn't have know about it otherwise.",5 
12,"This place is small but super friendly service! The food is so delicious. My mouth watered as the food hit my pallet! Must try, literally brought tears to my eye reminding me of some fresh home cooking on a vacation.",5 
13,"We had a classic -- bangers and mash. It was good but nothing special. It's not a huge portion, so I'd order some mashy peas or green beans to accompany. The view from the back booth is nice - looks like Diagon Alley. Wish I'd ordered a pie and some sticky toffee pud, but we were in a hurry to get out of there. It was cute, and the service was fine, but it was scorching hot inside, like stuffy, can't breathe. Sweating through one's clothes is not a pleasant dining experience!!",3 
14,"I heard great things about this place and couldn't wait to try it. I decided to let the waiter choose my meal and couldn't be happier!!! Steak pie, bubbles and squeak mash with farmer gravy. Food endorphin heaven. I wish they had this place in Bakersfield!!! Best service, great 70's music. More of a gastric experience than just a great meal. I have one complaint. I couldn't finish and we have no way to heat it up. SAD. I am SO glad we found Mother Mash. Must do in London!",5 
15,We tried the beef steak and minced meat pies which were both very good but everyone preferred the beef steak by a lot. I recommend the farmers gravy as it added good flavour to the mashed potatoes. The crust was flaky but firm and there were good chunks of beef in the steak pies.  The interior is nothing fancy so this is a good place to fill up and then get back to shopping or sightseeing. Service was fast and friendly. It was a great place to bring the family to experience a traditional meat pie while in London.,5 
16,"Traditional British food with plenty of vegan/vegetarian options. Enjoyed the mushroom and ale pie with diary free mash. & toffee pudding for dessert! Service was great and we enjoyed people watching during our 20ish min wait for good (granted, it was packed!)",4 
17,"Looking for a really tasty dinner in London that will fill you up and won't break the bank. Welcome to Mother Mash. Our trip to England was full of meat pies and this place had some of our favorites! We sat outside on the patio - if you do the same be prepared for some entertainment - this is a high traffic area full of fun and nightlife and some folks will stop and talk with you, or zoom past on a bike blasting music.",5 
18,"If you are looking for authentic British cuisine surrounded by beautiful architecture this is it! Their bangers and mash was fresh, delicious, and incredibly flavorful. I traveled across town to eat here and was not disappointed!!!",5 
19,"So so so good. I'm trying to figure out how to go back a second day in a row. I had the steak pie with horseradish mash, and the farmers gravy. The pie  crust was lovely and the interior was just delicious and the farmers gravy was the perfect compliment to it all. The horseradish came on the side of the mash (not incorporated), which was good because hubby isn't a fan and he could still sample some of the amazing steak pie! I loved the horseradish with a bit of the mash and the steak pie - great bite for me! The gravy was luscious and the mash was silky but not thin...just perfection. We also ordered the green beans and they were very nicely done. We ended with sticky toffee pudding which was very good - a nice cake with a lovely toffee sauce and another sauce on the side (like a crème anglais) and some vanilla ice cream. Service was good and friendly!",5
