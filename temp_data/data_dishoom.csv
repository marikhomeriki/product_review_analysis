0,"Hundreds of happy customers come through every hour.  Don't let the outdoor queue scare you off as it did me last night but I came back for lunch today and the line, albeit the length of the restaurant, only took 20 minutes or less.  All the employees were very courteous and pleasant.The chicken ruby was just amazing and very complex. There was not a drop left. The paneer tikka is probably meant to be shared  and was a bit underwhelming.  We got a downstairs table near the bar and dishwasher so it was terribly noisy with all the silverware.  But, it was also indicative just how popular this place is.",5 
1,"We came for breakfast on a Monday so we were able to bypass the usual line. If coming for dinner, I would definitely recommend making reservations.I had the pancakes and bacon naan for breakfast. Both were delicious. Despite the toffee sauce, the pancakes weren't overly sweet. The bacon naan has a nice tomato jam to help balance the bacon.Apparently the chai is bottomless and I missed the memo l until we were cashing out. Lesson learned.The kitchen downstairs smells incredible so I'll definitely be checking them out for dinner another day.",4 
2,"Have been wanting to go to Dishoom for years and I was glad it conveniently fit into my morning schedule. I passed it several times in the days before in the afternoons and the line gets insanely long for dinner time. I walked in and got seated with ease.The store itself is absolutely stunning. The area is huge. Even going downstairs to use the bathroom is like a different experience. I came around 9am during their breakfast menu, which I didn't know about. Guess I have to come back during later meals to try their other items.I got the keema per eedu. It was super flavorful and rich. Maybe I got too excited and scarfed it down too fast. It put me in a huge food coma. The liver, egg, and savory flavors felt heavy. It was an explosion in your mouth. I washed this down with chai and a cappuccino. The service was prompt. The store was scattered with some people out for leisure and business meals. There was always a consistent amount of people filling the shop throughout my meal. Gotta come back to try their regular menu--likely when I have more time in London!",4 
3,"The best Indian food in London!This is my 3rd visit to London and Dishoom, the quality of food hasn't changed and it's still the best Indian food in town",5 
4,"I'm sure there's not much more I could say because Dishoom is so famous and popular, but if it's any indication, we went for breakfast then went BACK for lunch on the same day. Everyone told us this restaurant is amazing and it very much lived up to the hype. Every dish was a revelation, especially the dal. I especially appreciated the kids menu. The staff was so lovely to my four-year-old child. Just perfect. I can't wait to eat here again.",5 
5,"4.5/5 stars As someone who isn't well versed in Indian food, the menu can be overwhelming. Our waiter was kind enough to explain that the dishes were meant to be shared, and he made recommendations for what dishes would be good. We got a few small plates: the Pau Bhaji (Mashed vegetables with buns) and the lamb samosa. Both of these were excellent. The lamb samosa was so crispy, hot, and flavorful. The Pau Bhaji was new for me. The bun was so fluffy and buttery and was perfect with the mashed vegetables. It just tasted like a herb/spice sauce.For our main entrees, we got the chicken berry biryani (chicken and rice dish) and the mutton pepper fry (curry dish) and added the raita (yogurt sauce). The chicken biryani was quite good, and the chicken was pretty tender. The raita was supposed to be used with the biryani, but it kinda made the dish too cold for my liking. The mutton pepper fry was tender and flavorful! It was spicy, but I was surprisingly able to tolerate it. We ordered garlic naan, which was perfect for scooping all the sauce. It didn't have a strong garlic flavor, and it wasn't piping hot. We also ordered the chili broccoli salad, which was divine! The combination of pistachios, seeds, and dates made the broccoli so tasty! Overall, I enjoyed our meal here and loved trying new foods! We came around 5:15 pm and didn't need to wait for a table, but when we left the restaurant, there was a huge line, so definitely try to go during off peak hours.",5 
6,"Food 5/5Ambiance 5/5Service 5/5You'll likely have to wait anywhere from 30 minutes to an hour for a table depending on the timing and your group size, but it's well worth it. They will sometimes pass out drinks to those waiting in line which is a nice touch. The food is stellar, though a bit different from your typical Indian restaurant in that it's more of a small plates style. Since portions are smaller, they recommend at least 2-3 plates per person here. My favorite was the Dishoom House Chaat, a dish that was recommended by our waiter. Note that unlike other Indian restaurants, they don't ask you for a preferred spice level on their dishes, so if you're particularly sensitive to spice, ask your waiter for specific recommendations. Ambiance is lively and there are neat booths downstairs where you can control the music level and (if I remember correctly) the fan as well- something I haven't seen at another restaurant. Bathrooms are also quite nice and clean- something that is always hugely appreciated in a big city like London. I will be making this a regular spot for anytime I'm in London!",5 
7,"It is a chain restaurant but nothing about it lacks the quality. This place is incredible and they need to come to the States! Its Indian cuisines and its has a wide array of options. I feel like this is perfect for people that might be intimidated by Indian food and want to try it for the first time. Theres so much great choices for various diets: vegetarians, vegans, carnivores, etc. My partner is a vegan and she was pleased with all the options. I went with the Ruby Chicken which is essentially a tika masala chicken. Run don't walk to get it. Very delicious and the sauce with some basmati rice is outstanding. The samosas are a great appetizer as well. The gunpowder potatoes was a great side. Never had potatoes that seasoned before.Disroom please please please make your way to New York. They longing for a restaurant like this.",5 
8,"Wow wow wow.. A very memorable experience and service provided by ALEX at this location on 3rd of November. Alex was attentive and charming, he made sure that my friends and I were well taken care of for the evening. I happen to have a mango allergy but the manager was able to resolve that issue quickly with a special menu that was checked off by the chef with all the dishes that did not have Mango in it. I was grateful and very appreciative of such wonderful gesture and hope the restaurant continues to provide this caliber of service in our future visits. Marvelous time spent and would highly recommend this location to anyone who is visiting London. Thank you Alex!Food was also absolutely delicious, dare I say some of the best Indian cuisine I've had so far? Make reservations if you can to avoid the long long line outside.",5 
9,"Came here for an early lunch when passing through the UK a while back and wow...the best indian food I have eaten out at a restaurant!! I generally don't eat indian food out because my parents are amazing cooks and we can enjoy good food from the comfort of our home most times. Before I came to the UK, numerous people raved about Dishoom telling me it was a must go!We had a quick stopover in the UK and made it a priority to come here! One thing to note is that they have breakfast hours where they serve a completely different menu from the regular lunch/dinner food. We had showed up early and they were still serving brunch. Call and check this in advance because we ended up waiting over an hour in the restaurant to get lunch food! Nonetheless, the wait was worth it!The ambiance of this spot it really pleasant and unique. We were treated so wonderfully by the staff and service was quite quick once lunch opened. We ordered a few different entrees -- chili chicken, chicken, daal, chicken tikka, and naan. We also got a mango lassi and rice on the side. The food was amazing! Flavors were solid, and meat was tender. I highly recommend all the dishes we ordered because I would 100% order them all again.",5 
10,"This was a stop during our first trip to London. The food was worth the hype for us. We had the uttapam pancakes with Shrikhand, chicken ruby, cheese toast, jackfruit biryani, and the chicken tikka roll. The breakfast menu wasn't our thing but lunch was absolutely delicious. The chicken was perfectly cooked, the service was excellent, and the ambience was perfect for brunch. I would return.",5 
11,The food was sooo amazing I forgot to take pictures before I ate it all. Dishoom is an absolute must if you are in london. Make sure you make a reservation or else you will have a wait!!! The ambiance is so nice and the staff is super attentive. The Ruby chicken was amazing. The tandoori chicken was juicy with just the right amount of charcoal grill. The garlic naan was perfect to dip in the sauce. Ugh- I will forever dream about this meal!!!,5 
12,The line is always so long here--so get here early. I got in at 6pm on a Friday and waited for about an hour.The food here is amazing! Especially the daal! It's so rich and creamy. The ruby chicken and the vegetable dish that came with buns were great too!It's absolutely worth the wait,5 
13,"I had to come back to Dishoom. The wait was about 45mins and and they were so kind to be handing out chai and wine. Our waiter was so nice and explained the menu. The food was sooo good! The naan was extra soft. The drinks were strong, as they should be  I will definitely be coming back. This location is convenient and close to bars/pubs and the theater.",5 
14,"On a visit to London, we stopped by Dishoom as it was highly recommended on the internet.  They have indoor and outdoor seating as of this review, and also free wifi.  The restaurant has two levels, and has gorgeous decor.  We were able to walk in and get seated immediately on a Friday late afternoon.We had the mango lassi:  nice yogurty mango drink.  Not too sweet, and topped with fennel seeds.  Not sure what the fennel seeds were for except decoration as it wasn't very edible.  Still very good, 4/5  Basmati rice: a bit dry but still edible.   3/5Chicken berry britannia: oddly has cranberries in it.  Lots of chicken in it. 4.5/5Chicken ruby:  creamy and rich with a nice hint of ginger.  4.5/5Garlic naan: thin and crispy, dotted with lots of fresh garlic and made by hand.  Highly recommend! 5/5Lamb samosas: wish they were bigger; they were tiny!  Thin crispy outer layer.  4.5/5All in all, this place was pretty packed for a reason.  Great comfort food, very salty though.",5

16,"Finally tried the famous Dishoom on a recent trip to London. I was prepared for a long line for dinner and I think in total it took about 45 minutes for my party of 1. While in line the passed out samples of their chai which was a great way to get ready for the meal. I was seated in the back courtyard which was perfect though I will say the action seems to be downstairs with hustle and bustle. For my meal I got the vegetable samosas (phenomenal!), garlic naan, and the chicken ruby. There were so many options to choose from I would've liked to split a few things with friends to really get a sampling. Overall a nice experience!",4 
17,"Heard many raving reviews about this place and had to wait 30 mins to get a spot; it was solid but maybe didn't quite live up to the hype.The waiter recommended we each pick 3 items. I got the murgh malai, roomali roti, and kachumber. The chicken was tender and flavorful, and the roti was warm and yummy.Overall a solid choice!",4 
18,"Allergy friendly restaurant - They went above and beyond to accommodate our allergies and dietary restrictions. There's a separate vegan menu. I received a binder of allergen matrix (excel sheets) to cross reference against allergens and menu items. The chef also marked up a menu for me, crossing out and checking off items that I can(not) have. I wish every place was like this! Our server was also patient and amazing! House chai - Subtly sweet with a strong ginger taste. Love it! My friend tried mine and ended up getting her own for dessert. Chicken ruby with garlic naan - Similar to butter chicken and absolutely delicious! There's a lot of chicken for the small dish. Garlic naan wasn't anything special, could be more garlicky. Murgh Malai - Perfectly seasoned and tender chicken dish but not particularly special. Chicken Berry Britannia - Delicious and definitely would get again!Chef's Covent Garden Special: Tila-Foi's Very Best Masala Fish - Very spicy, and too spicy for me, so it's hard to tell if it's good. Dishoom House Chaat - Delicious! Kind of get the flavors of a Vietnamese Spring Roll. Roti - Nothing specialMango kulfi - Disappointing in presentation. It's just a mango popsicle on a chopstick in a glass cup. Kala Khatta Gola Ice - Very strong on the spice side rather than sweetness. It was not a favorite. We had reservations for a party of 6, booked 1-2 months ahead. We noticed the non-reservation line was down the street!",5 
19,"I was in London for 6 days and came twice to this restaurant. This speaks volumes for their food. The stars off are not for the food. The wait is 30 to 45 minutes, so be prepared.The food is outstanding - chicken tikka masala, mutton ruby, jackfruit biryani, garlic naan.1 star off - Service is mixed. They are not as attentive, which is understandable as the restaurant is huge.1 star off - They use this ridiculous QR code for payment and don't accept cash. This is unfortunate if you don't want to enter your credit card information through their website.",3 
20,Some of the best flavors I've ever had outside of India. Truly a worthwhile experience.,5 
21,"Just fabulous from the setting to the instructive service to of course food and drink. Two fun non alcohol cocktails I enjoyed the sober Negroni with my spicy mutton. While it is deceptively large restaurant, there were still ques to get in right after opening.",5 
22,"Dishoom came highly recommended by a friend. I didn't make a reservation because I figured it would be quick for a single person to get seated but I was wrong, it was still 30+ minute wait standing in line in the heat. The cocktails were delicious! I had the Fizz and the Cabana Colada which was amazing. The food was good but I think I set the bar too high. I got the veggie samosas which were good but nothing out of this world and I got the Veggie mash dish which came with a side of a roll. I would have preferred if it came with a side of Naan. I ordered that separately which was very tasty.",4 
23,"Came by for breakfast the other morning and it was a world class experience. Made a reservation for a table and my table was ready upon arrival.The dining room seemed to be split up into 3 sections, the lower level, the street level, along with an outdoor-esque area on the street level. The décor of the dining room felt like time travel to India with the smell of some incense? as well when entering.Waiter was fantastic guiding me through the menu. Started off with the bottomless chai and it was excellent. Very fragrant and strong.Had the wrestler's naan for breakfast and it was world class. The naan was super fresh and fluffy. The eggs were cooked to perfection, super thick egg whites and solid orange yolk. The bacon was cooked to perfection without being super salty and the sausage was also excellent without being too salty! Portions were generous too!They have free Wifi.£16 for breakfast after service and GST.",5 
24,"**July 2022: Friday Afternoon Visit**My friend and I had multiple friends who stated that Dishoom was a must stop and by sheer luck we noticed that this Dishoom was along our route from the British Museum to the Palace Theater. At noon we walked in and were taken downstairs to their enormous seating area. That wasn't the case when my friend and I walked back from the theater (there was a line that wrapped around the building for the dinner rush - 6pm ish)If I were to describe Dishoom it's like a very trendy upscale Indian Restaurant that sort of gives me Cheesecake Factory feels (in terms of it's grandness and over the top space and atmosphere). After reviewing the extensive menu we decided on the following to share. Meal Pau Bhahi £5.90: Bowl of Mashed Vegetables with Hot Butter, homemade buns - I loved this as a starter! The buns were luxurious and buttery and a great way to pile on the veggie spread.Chicken Ruby £13.50: Tastes like Chicken Tikki Marsala - Solid and I would order this again.     Garlic Naan £3.90: It was okay, not as light and fluffy as I've had at other places, but I still used it to dip into the various curriesTandoori Roti £3.50: Didn't care for it. I'd passBlack Daal £7.50: I think this is a very hearty lentil curry. It's quite filling but among the three curry dishes this was my least favorite - not that it was bad, but the others were more of my taste. I think if I were to do this again I'd take this out of my order.  They charge an automatic 12.50 service charge (tip)SummaryOverall, it's a very nice UK chain restaurant to visit. It's comfortable, well lit, accessible and classy.",4 
25,"House chaat 8.65/10- sweet potato with the crisps was a great texture and flavor. Really enjoyed how they had chutney included House chai 7.32/10- it was okay, not as much of a chai flavor as expected. Way too hot when it first came out Masala fish 7.34/10- this was good, very spicy but flavorful but only due to the spices tbh. The fish was huge alsoKebab 5.64/10- good however could use a lot more flavor and was also kind of small. The onions in compliments added a lot to the kebab Chicken 7.32/10- this was really good and juicy however it was also a bit bland, wish it had more spice to it Basmati rice 7.43/10- pretty average rice",3 
26,"WOW!!! If it is your final night in London, do not leave without dining at Dishoom. * Spicy Lamb Chops* Chicken Ruby* Raita* Kachumber* Garlic Naan* Peacock CiderEvery single item we ordered was outstanding!!!! Everything. The cider included. The lamb chops stole the show. Thick, succulent, herb-spiced. I have never had lamb chops like this before. Even our waiter said these were his top 3 chops he has ever had. I would agree. You will want to eat all of the meat to the bone. The Chicken Ruby, their name for ""curry""  has tender, succulent chunks of chicken that has been marinated for 24+ hours in a nutty, butter sauce. There are no nuts (my friend is allergic) but the flavor is hearty and earthy. So good! Raita could have been a little thicker but the flavor made up for that. Kachumber reminded me of a greek salad but with cilantro (coriander) and green chili peppers. The lime brings a balances the dish and cuts the spice from the chili pepper nicely. While I have had better garlic Naan, it was not a disappointment. I washed everything down with a glass of Peacock Cider and hope to be able to find it back in the states. Beautiful interior decor that is modern, and stylish without being flashy. Perfect for a date or a night out with friends. On my next visit to London I will absolutely return to Dishoom.",5 
27,"Indian Flavors From Bombay with Love is Dishoom's signature phrase and with multiple locations in London, it's clear that Dishoom is a hit with locals and visitors alikeIndian cuisine is the most cited must-try cuisines in London and I was glad we made reservations to Dishoom's Covent Garden locationLines were out the door our whole meal and reached 1.5 hours long and Dishoom has been on the scene for several yearsTheir winning formula includes accessible dishes, stellar flavors, creative drinks and shareable plates perfect for big and small groups alikeI enjoyed my dinner so much that I returned the next morning to try their signature breakfast naan and it was definitely a trip highlight Wrestler's Naan (Peppery Bacon, Sausage and Runny Yolked Egg) £10.50 / Prawn Koliwada £8.50 / Okra Fries £5.70 / Chicken Ruby £13.50 / Spicy Lamb Chops £15.90 / Gunpowder Potatoes £6.90 / Tila-Foi's Very Best Masala Fish £18.50 / House Black Daal £7.50 / Roomali Roti £3.50 / Mango & Fennel Lassi £4.40 / Rose & Cardamon Lassi £4.40 / Mango Kulfi £4.50Dishoom Covent Garden (London, United Kingdom)Dishoom accepts credit cards and is mainly indoor dining with a small section of patio.",5 
28,"Decided to come try out Dishoom while on a trip to London since it was one the ""must-try"" Indian restaurants in the city. We went to Covent Garden location as it was close to the area we were exploring. There was a long line to get in but it went by pretty past and they even served us House Chai while we waited which tasted great! I tried the Chicken Ruby with garlic naan. I asked the waiter for a dish similar to Butter Chicken and she mentioned that the Chicken Ruby was basically the same thing. While I enjoyed the dish, it did not taste like butter chicken and was actually very different. Forgot the name of the drink I got but it was delicious!",5 
29,"This Indian restaurant chain, is one of the best Indian restaurants I have been to in all my travels... They have various locations throughout London.  we dined in Covent gardens very popular area, people love this restaurant we waited an hour for our table but, it was well worth it ...the tikka chicken was delicious the prawns , the sweet potato with yogurt and pomegranate seeds so flavorful.  we had a little bit of everything and then for dessert... yum!  we had the warm dark chocolate pudding and one of their ice cream pistachio Kulfi( basically ice cream on a stick) but so delicious. I wish I could package this restaurant up and take it back to the states with me... i'll be back in three weeks and you can better believe I will make my reservation now...",5 
30,"THIS INDIAN FOOD, WOW!!I had 3 traveller friends recommend this restaurant so I knew I had to try it!There was a long line out the door, but wait time was only 30 minutes. The girl doing check ins was told my MIL injured her leg, so she and my FIL were allowed to sit at the bar to relax until a table became ready. So considerate!We enjoyed every bite of our food.We ordered:Rose lassi (unique)ChaatGunpowder potatoesRuby chickenMatter paneer Vegetarian biryani (unique)Desserts: kneer (has blueberry in it) and chili brownie and ice cream (unique) The service was knowledgeable and attentive. I wish I could try everything off their menu!If I'm ever back in the London area I'll be back for more!",5 
31,"We got to Soho and there was a long wait to get in this restaurant. I was so excited because I wanted to know if the hype of it all was represented in the food. When we went in I smelled all the aroma of something great as far as Indian food. Everyone seem to be having such a great time and the Decor was just very eclectic and homey. I will say everyone who worked there was super nice and the service was great. However, I did not like the food. I looked around and there was another couple at the other table across from us and it didn't appear that they liked the food either. We ordered the samosas and they were tiny and crunchy and not like a regular Samosa at all. Didn't like these and wouldn't order these again. I also ordered the butter chicken and I was not a fan of the butter chicken, it had another name on the menu but basically this is what it was...The chicken was fatty and had some skin on it and the sauce was gritty almost pasty. My friend got the lamb chops and they were over cooked. There was an OK flavor there but when you over cook lamb chops that is kind of a terrible thing. I got a drink and the drink was OK but nothing to write home about. The garlic naan was gross. It didn't have a garlic flavor at all.I think the atmosphere here  was far better than the food. My experience at another Indian restaurant here was far better than Dishoom.",2 
32,"The line in Convent Garden at around 9 pm only took us 45 minutes, way better than their busiest location near Carnaby if I may say. This is also a newer and bigger location so the ambience is amazing.We ordered the chicken ruby, chicken berry biryani, veggie samosas, and garlic naan. Everything was amazing!! It was worth the wait and hype. 5/5.",5 
33,"After having owned the cookbook from Dishoom for a while, I was really excited to try the dishes straight from the origin. I made a reservation for one during lunch hours on a long layover I had in London. A reservation is definitely recommended, by the time I was leaving, there was a line outside. As soon as I walked into the restaurant, I was taken by the gorgeous interiors. You can tell that the decor was carefully picked out and the detailing of every element of the restaurant was beautiful. It's a lovely ambiance to have a meal in. When I sat down, they handed me this cute paper menu that looked like a newspaper. Since I was dining alone, I asked the waitress for her best recommendations. She gave me several options from the small plates, entrees, and breads/rices. I started with the house chai. Then I chose a small plate--the okra fries, an entree--the lamb chops, and a garlic naan to go with it. The chai came out first and that was so delicious; I had 3 glasses (btw, they refill the chai for free!). Then came the okra fries and wow. That was one of the best preparations of okra I've ever tasted. Then my lamb chops and garlic naan came, and if you come here, you HAVE to try the lamb chops. They were cooked to perfection and extremely delicious. The garlic naan I probably could have done without with this dish, it was a bit thin and less fluffy than I was expecting. Overall, I absolutely loved this restaurant. It is a place not to be missed. I look forward to coming back in the future to try more of their dishes.",5 
34,"We went here with a friend and had a great time.  The line is pretty ridiculous, but it moved quickly, and I appreciated that they brought refreshing drinks out to us while we waited.  Inside, it was packed and lively.  The food was great.  We definitely over ordered.  The most surprising thing was a dish with jackfruit.  Not surprising was that their famous black daal was fantastic.  Worth the line.",4 
35,"When I was in London a month prior, I had been unable to get a reservation at Dishoom and the line to get in was down the block. I made a point to make a reservation for my return trip, and even a few weeks out could only get a very late lunch or very early dinner reservation. This probably is somewhere it's better to come with a group so that you can try different things, but as a solo traveler I had the:CHEF'S COVENT GARDEN SPECIAL (TILA-FOI'S VERY BEST MASALA FISH)Aunty-ji's recipe, refined over decades with love. Two fillets of sea bream marinated in Tila-foi's masala with ginger-garlic, black pepper, lime juice, carrom seeds and red chilli. Griddled within a banana leaf and served to share. Eat with companionable Coconut Chaas.It says served to share but I definitely ate the whole thing myself. It was very flavorful and to the disappointment of the server, I did not eat it with the Coconut Chaas, but rather, plain. I found that there were so many spices and flavors in the fish that I did not want to drown it in a yogurt/sauce.I would love to try some of their more ""traditional"" dishes (that you would find on the menu at other Indian restaurants) so that I could do a comparison, but at the same time, why get something that you can get anywhere. I suppose this is why you need to come with a group (if you can get a reservation!).All in all I had a great experience here but am not sure that I'd wait in a long line (very good, but not amazing).",4 
36,"Always the best food! I have always gone to Dishoom for dinner. On a recent trip to London, I was able to get there for brunch before leaving for the airport. Like everything else, the naan roll hit the spot. If I lived in London, I'd be here every week. Also shoutout to the chai...it's yummy!",5 
37,"One of the best and most consistently great restaurants in London.  This is one of my regular go-to's and somewhere I like take people who are coming from out of town.  There are multiple locations each with a slightly different ambiance but the food is always good at each of them. My typical order includes the following:Prawn koliwada: This is a great starter that comes in a cute bowl filled with succulent prawns that come with some heat.  They are slightly crispy on the outside, juicy on the inside.  They pair well with any of the sauces and chutneys they bring to your table.  I like to mix the spicy and mild together (orange/red and green sauces) Garlic cheese naan: I mean, is there a better combination? The naan has a great cheese pull and is filled with chilli's for a perfect light kick.  Chicken tikka: no, this isn't chicken tikka masala.  This is grilled chicken thighs with some lovely seasoning and comes with a coriander (cilantro) and red onion garnish.  Simple but executed well 24 hour daal: do yourself a favour and order this.  These lentils have been stewing away for 24 hours and are a great component with your meal.  Creamy texture and flavourful, quite comforting.  Chilli chicken: my second favorite small dish.  This chicken packs quite some spice but it's a can't miss dish.  The chicken is crunchy and gently coated with a chilli sauce that isn't overbearing in terms off the amount.  So, you want to dine here? They only take reservations for larger groups which means you have to queue (wait in line) but it's absolutely worth it.  You can put your name in and grab a nice drink from the bar but do expect at least an hour wait so you can factor that in to when you arrive.  Happy eating!",5 
38,"Dishoom is a London staple and one of the most must-try restaurants in the city. Come order delicious Bombay cuisine off the large, newspaper-styled menu while enjoying a casual, Indian summer breeze kind of vibe.My favorites are the house black daal (rich and complex flavors!), the chicken ruby, and the mutton pepper fry. The prawn koliwada also makes a nice appetizer, and the roti is great for dipping and soaking up various saucy dishes.If you come before noon, you can enjoy their fabulous breakfast instead. The Big Bombay has everything savory you could want, including scrumptious akuri (like spicy scrambled eggs) and masala beans. Meanwhile, if you want something sweet, go for the uttapam stack: pancake-like, topped with creamy-yet-fluffy, sweet-yet-slightly-tangy whipped yogurt and berries. Enjoy it all with the bottomless house chai.There are multiple locations, but this one in Covent Garden is my favorite for being casual yet comfortable and very spacious. There's often a line, but it moves quickly (e.g., less than 30 minutes -- and they'll bring complementary chai and mint tea while you wait!).Overall an excellent choice for tourists or locals alike!",5 
39,"Been wanting to try out Dishoom for the longest time as it is the most reviewed place in London, insane considering there are other world-famous landmarks like the Big Ben and the British Museum. Made a reservation online and was seated promptly in a cute dome-shaped booth.- Chicken Ruby - This is essentially butter chicken and I really enjoyed the flavor which had hints of ginger in it. The chicken was also very tender and flavorful. My one complaint though is that the dish didn't come with naan or rice and this is given that you know, so you do have to order an extra side in order for the main dish to not be so salty.- Garlic Naan - Good relief from the saltiness of the chicken ruby. To be honest, you couldn't really taste the garlic bit of it, so I wouldn't say you have to order the garlic flavored naan. Overall, pretty solid Indian place. Not sure if it lives up to the hype of being the most reviewed place in London but the food was all-around very good. My other only complaint is that it was my friend's birthday and they gave us a dessert to celebrate with a candle. The dessert was good but it was not free which is what it usually is in America, so that was a bit disappointing but now I know.",4 
40,"finally got to try dishoom which had been the top of my list for a while! id heard raving reviews so my expectations were highbut first, context: i am a student in a budget and was dining with just another broke student, so price was a consideration. thus we had to choose our dishes wisely- vegetable samosa: 3/5. the taste was standard, but quite small. i expected maybe two samosas but each large, instead of four small ones. - the masala fish chef's special: 5/5. god, the star of the show. it was unique, wrapped in a bamboo leaf, packed with flavor and slightly crispy on the outside but tender on the inside. paired very nicely with the coconut chaas, which i LOVED (tasted like strawberry yogurt)- bowl of greens: 3/5. i mean, its just broccoli and snow peas, but they did the job of serving as a break from the savoriness - chicken tikka: 4/5. we ordered this after realizing that what we got was not enough. in terms of price, this was the best value. the chicken was tender and, though it is plain in color, PACKED with lots of spice, so have water ready. came with a side of red onion and parsley. overall service was a 5/5: our waitress was sweet and came to check on us several times but not in an annoying way. also the payment system is v high tech!",4 
41,"Stopped by on a busy Friday evening - the wait was around 40 mins. Got to enjoy some complementary excellent cups of chai and some sherry while waiting in line which only made me hungrier and ready to sink my teeth into some delicious food. Our server was attentive and friendly and made some excellent recommendations and helped us navigate the menu. From the grill section, we ordered the murgh malai and spicy lamb chops - both succulent and well marinated. Didn't love the ruby chicken gravy - too tomato-EY for my taste but did appreciate how juicy and delicious the chicken was in it. The garlic naan was . The shrimp was a fun dish to try out as well - crispy and spicy. For the drinks, I tried (and loved) the 1948 sour. My husband had the India gimlet, which he enjoyed as well. For dessert, we tried the kala khata gola, which was an interesting, albeit inauthentic version of the traditional.",4 
42,"Fresh, bursting flavors. Service and atmosphere exceptional.Okra, Ruby Chicken and Tikka chicken all exceptional. We never felt rushed, staff is fantastic!",5 
43,"One of the best meals I had in London. I would go back every single time. The food is delicious, the decor is amazing, and the servers know what they're talking about!There's plenty of seating so if you see a queue don't fret! It moves very quickly!!",5 
44,"Nice restaurant but the food was a little underwhelming. We ordered a variety of dishes and everything was just okay. The menu is big and there are a lot of nice options. The service was great and the atmosphere was cool and dark. Overall, I am glad we tried but would maybe try the breakfast next time.",3 
45,"Definitely don't miss coming here when you come to London. There's a reason Dishoom's are remarkably well known and famous. The entire experience was incredible. It can take a bad day you've had and make into a spectacular day; even when if you have to wait up to an hour in the queue (which moves quick, the restaurant has multiple floors!).There's so much to explore on the menu, that my memory won't do it justice giving you the rundown on items ordered. Trust your wait staff, your senses and instincts when you come here. Don't be in a hurry and enjoy tasting so many dishes. The portion sizes were perfect!Spectacular experience.",5 
46,"Great indian fusion restaurant Not for the ones that looks for the authentic tase of India, but extremely good",4 
47,"My first time eating Indian food in over 14 years. First time I wasn't a fan at all and avoided the dishes at all costs. I so happened to be in London for vacay and was told to try this place. Going in with an open mind, I tried it and absolutely loved it. I went back to back nights for dinner!",5 
48,this place changed my life. definitely go if ur in london! make sure to get:-chicken ruby-chaat-okra fries - mango lassi- chai (!!!!)one note is that if you have allergies they will provide a comprehensive breakdown of each dish. however they will not allow certain modifications (e.g. exclusion of nuts),5 
49,Awesome food !!!!!!Reasonable price!Service and ambience - excellent Chai tea was pretty good too (not sure why people hype about it tbh. But I mean it's okay)Chicken Tikka with garlic naan are a must try !,5 
50,"LOVE this spot! I tried going to the Kings Cross location twice after work and both times, there was a line so I didn't wait. I went to this location once too and there was also a line so I didn't wait. I then finally went online to make a reservation, and the only available reservations were around 4:30PM/5PM, which is usually too early for me except for the day I went! I made a reservation for 5:15PM and I think I got there a bit early, probably around 5PM. I was seated immediately and there was no line yet, but while I was there, the line outside grew and grew. So happy I made a reservation! Anyway, the food. I was given a quick rundown of the menu and recommendations without asking for them, and I ended up getting:- mango & fennel lassi: I've had mango lassis before but never with fennel seeds (although to be honest, I don't think the fennel seeds added anything). - pau bhaji which is mashed vegetables with bread: A bit light on the flavor for the vegetables but the bread was perfectly toasted, soft inside and crunchy outside.- tila foi which is fish wrapped in a banana leaf: The fish was a tad spicy but super flavorful, and I enjoyed the pink yogurt that came on the side with it. - garlic naan: The naan was a bit flat for my taste, not chewy, and very oily - that was probably my least favorite item from everything I ordered.- basmati kheer: This almost looked like a creme brulee with a caramelized, burnt top, and underneath it was rice pudding. Not too sweet which I appreciated, and the blueberry compote on top was delicious, wish there was more of it.Everything was super flavorful and unique! I really enjoyed the food here. Service was quite good too although I had to ask for utensils; my server looked confused that I didn't have any.Food was pretty pricey although I did order a lot, came out to be around 45 GBP. Would highly recommend, but definitely make a reservation! There's also pretty good wifi here.",5 
51,"Waited in line for an hour to get seated - the staff were very helpful as we waited and gave us regular updates and hot cups of free chai.The food is very good but I wouldn't say it was the ""best Indian ever"" like some of the reviews here describe - for example the house Chaat came with soggy potatoes and the lamb chops could have used more seasoning. Overall, our favorite was the Ruby chicken - it was a delight to try parsi cuisine as it's not very common back home in the US. The free chai was also excellent btw and I'm gonna look up the recipe to see if I can replicate at home!",4 
52,The best Indian food of my life! And great atmosphere and service and location. We arrived after attending the theatre and there was no line.,5 
53,"Very central location in Covent Garden, quick walk away from Leicester Square. Most reviews are from Americans visiting London and not from locals. Line out the door and informed of 60 min wait, nice touch to serve chai outside while waiting. It was a 30 min wait outside and another 15 min at the bar. I don't really like this trick of having the patrons seated at the bar while the table is being made ready for you. Seems like a strategy to put the guest on the spot to order a drink. The non-alcohol pineapple cream drink was very refreshing, frothy and icy, coconut flakes served on top. Seated downstairs, although would have preferred upstairs, but with these wait times what can you do, and it would be long waits at most good places in the area. Open style kitchen where you can see the chefs flaming things up on the grill and beating up the naan dough. Prices are cheap looking, but portion sizes slightly smaller. Not so many sauce dishes. I had the dry style chicken tikka. No yoghurt, instead marinated in vinegar. It was very good quality chicken. Chicken Berry biryani also good, cooked properly and not just mixed chicken and rice. No complaints about the naan. Very difficult to get a reservation unless far in advance.",4 
54,"The first Indian food I ever had was in London. The place was called Top Curry Centre. Sadly the place was shuttered just this past year due to the pandemic. I asked the hotel concierge who recommended Dishoom and now I know why. It's good I came for lunch because the lines around the block for dinner were outrageous. For lunch I was seated promptly to the lower level near the open kitchen. The place was bustling with diners and understandably so. This place was fantastic! The food here had depths of flavor you won't get at any Devon avenue place in Chicago which makes me wonder what happened to the Indian food in America which just got so bland. Anyway I digress, check out the pics and they will speak for themselves. When in London, this is a must go!",5 
55,"Okay, i didn't have  a reservation.  Therefore, we  went early hoping to get a table. The hostess was very friendly and sat us very quickly. The menu is extensive and can be a bit overwhelming.  We decided to ask the food server for recommendations.  We ended up ordering 4 dishes with some garlic naan.   Here are our favorites in order Chicken Ruby-  let's just say, we wanted to lick the bowl it came in. House Black Daal- this dish complimented the chicken ruby. I think it would compliment any dish really well.  Okra fries- the  seasoning they put on these lovely treats is addicting Raita- glad we ordered this. It definitely helped cool down the spice level of the sheekh kabab. Sheekh kabab- we probably could have done without this dish. It was our least favorite.  I like spicy and this was too spicy.  We didn't finish this dish. Bastmati Rice- we initially forgot to order rice.  Luckily, we remembered before the food arrived.  We used the rice to soak up the ruby sauce and daal, so good. Garlic Naan- it was good The okra, chicken and daal was enough considering . we ordered rice and naan.    I would definitely go back for the above.  I would pass on the kabab and raita",4 
56,"We had to wait in line for about 40 mins but they brought us sherry to warm us and we loved the bustling two story dining rooms. The menu is large and everything was delicious. We started with vegetable samosas (good but small), Pau Bhaji (delicious and fun to assemble). Then we had the signature black daal (good but not earth shattering), the jackfruit biryani (get this!), the mattar paneer (also a winner), the raita (thick and a generous portion), and the kachumber (good for your vegetable fix). We washed it all down with mango and rose lassis--also recommended.",5 
57,"this place is crazy good.it had been recommended to me before, so i knew it must be at least alright if it was worthy of recommendation. but i was blown away by how literally every item i tasted on the menu was mouthwateringly delicious. the bhindi fries, the bhel, the samosas, the mattar paneer, the potatoes, and that daal! the drinks were incredible too- the bollybellini is a drink i was thinking about for so long after that i actually looked the recipe up on the internet and will now be making it at home.plus, our waitress was absolutely lovely - so warm, and so patient at explaining the menu to some of our friends who had allergies.dishoom is so popular that it doesn't need more recommendations - people are clearly already aware how good it is - but here's some tips: get the daal. dip the gunpowder potatoes in the chili tomato chutney. and get the bollybellini- you will not regret it!",5 
58,"Not huge on Indian food but this was hands down the best I had. I won't bother trying to ""name that dish"" because quite frankly I'm unfamiliar with them and would butcher the spelling regardless.The portions are on the smaller side, much like tapas, so be sure to try many! The na'an is made fresh in the kitchen on the bottom floor so be sure to try it.",5 
59,"Came here for brunch. Food and mimosas were good! Just a bit small on the portions, which is to be expected. I had the Parsi Omelette.",4 
60,So so good! Great service by the staff. Love that they give included refills on the house chai. Dishes were spicy!,5 
61,"Loud, crowded and absolutely fun! Food was tasty and service smoothDecor is worth going there for",5 
62,We went to the Covent gardens location. We could not get a reservation but they accepted walk ins. We arrived just as breakfast was ending and lunch was starting. They had amazing oat milk chai and my son had a vegan mango lassi.They had vegan and gf options and all the food was good. The puris that hubby got were a bit burned and the charged per extra puri requested.Service was good and the place was very busy.Definitely a family favourite!!,4 
63,"The best Indian restaurant I have ever visited. Love the modern take on traditional dishes. The chai tea was strong and perfectly sweetened. The ruby chicken is the star of the show and a must order. The chef's special fish was good but very spicy! The corn was pretty standard, as was the broccoli salad. The gulab jamun dessert is also a must order. Everything was fantastic. This location is the only one that allows reservations online in the daytime (not dinner). Lines get super long but absolutely worth the wait",5 
64,"Yum yum in my tum tum because the food here is fabulous. Only gripe is that the portions are a bit small so we ended up ordering more after we were done eating. Absolutely order the Chicken Ruby. It is knee slapping good. Pair it with some garlic naan and you won't have any curry left to lick out of the bowl. We also ordered the watermelon and passion fruit drinks, which were completely guilt free as they were only 67 calories and remarkably refreshing.Be sure to make reservations beforehand as they are extremely popular. I apologize for the low quality photos as they were screenshots from excitement-fueled videos",5 
65,"Waited about 45 minutes in a Thursday night...they come around with a wonderful drink while you wait.  Worth it, very cool place with excellent food and service.",5 
66,"Vibrant and exciting restaurant located now in Covent Gardens! The wait to enter was worthwhile. All of our dishes were fabulous. Although the service was generally good, we had to ask for water refills several times.",4 
67,"The most basic of basic Indian food for your crowd that don't know any better. Lamb chops were OK, but most of the curries had a very herby flavour. Presentation is nice, but not worth it when it's awkward to move the plates around and make room. Tiny portions and most of the menu's light lunches are, again, very basic. Go to Eailing road and take your pick of any Indian shop there to get the most genuine stuff.",1 
68,"I wanted to check out the hype so my friend and I got into the long queue outside the doors on a Thursday evening. The line moved quickly, but for my party of 5, we got sat in 10 minutes! Our waiter was very accommodating to us putting in our orders multiple times and keeping our menu with us.Specifically for the food, it was absolutely delicious, especially for the price. THE CHAI was bottomless and the best chai I've actually ever had. We had asked the server for advice on what to order and all of it was delicious.Things I ordered that I would definitely get again: Bhel, Chili Chicken, Chai, Lamb Seekh Kabab, Mattar Paneer, Kulfi Malai",5 
69,"Dishoom is probably my favorite restaurant on planet earth, and I'm not even a huge fan of Indian food. I strongly recommend a double order of the lamb chops.",5 
70,"First breakfast in London when we arrived from the U.S.! The restaurant was walking distance from our hotel. Loved the interior decor, very Parisan with a modern twist. Was worried I should have made reservations beforehand, but the restaurant was pretty empty, got a spot by the windows. Ordered the Parsi omelette and sausage & egg naan roll. They are known for their naan rolls and it didn't disappoint! The sunny side-up egg paired so well with the sausage and tomato chili jam. Still thinking about this dish! The Parsi omelette was tasty, but not anything outstanding. The plate they served it on was beautiful though.",5 
71,"Some of the most mouth watering Indian food I've ever had! So much flavor so much taste. A must try for breakfast, lunch or dinner when you are in London. I will certainly be back here in my next trip.",5 
72,"Wonderful dining experience when in London.  We went to the Covent Garden location.  It was fabulous!  My husband likes Indian food butafter Dishoom, he has changed his tune!  Our adult boys were with us, youngest was studying abroad in London & they love it too.  Our sonwished he would have discovered it while he was there, rather than onthe last day of our visit to pick him up & bring him home!  Great food, lots of variety for all tastes.  Definitely a crowd pleaser!",5 
73,"If we could do a 6-star review for Dishoom, we would. This was our FAVORITE breakfast in a two week trip to Europe! We made sure to make a reservation, as we'd read how crowded it can get. There was a line from opening time and they were consistently seating tables. The ambiance and atmosphere is so beautiful and peaceful and a great complement to the food.We both had the house chai (which I would have taken a jug of with me, if I could). It is warm with a bit of spice and just makes you feel calm and happy. It's the perfect morning drink. It's also bottomless until 5 pm so they will continue to give you refills (and the price was only 3.50 GBP--a steal!). I had the double bacon naan roll and my husband had the Wrestler's naan roll and we also got the uttapam pancakes to share. This was a lot of food for us in the morning so we couldn't finish the pancakes but I still have dreams about how amazing the naan rolls were. The bacon is amazing and so flavorful, the naan is very fresh and then it's complemented with a balance of cilantro as a garnish, cream cheese spread on the naan, and a tomato-chili jam which is not too spicy and out of this world. It was so good we went to Dishoom Kings Cross two days later to get the same breakfast and buy their house chai to bring home!!! If I could have breakfast here every day, I would and probably wouldn't get tired of it. Run, don't walk to Dishoom!",5 
74,"If you like Indian food but are wary of the consistently great reviews (and long lines at some of their locations) - come here! The food is worth it! Food/drinks: We were advised to get 6 plates to share for 2, and ended up with dahl, fried mutton,  veggie bowl, naan, roti, and - my personal favorite - fish cooked in banana leaves. It was slightly more food than we needed but with the explosive flavors and tender preparation, was worth every bite. Service: It was fine. We were seated quickly for lunch, our server explained the menu and gave good suggestions. They did get busy so we had to flag her down for the bill. Ambiance: Memorable. We sat inside on the main floor, but it's worth a peak at the lower level as well. There were so many thoughtful details pointing to an Indian-British nostalgic vibe, down to the toilets in the ladies bathroom. Also fun to see the open kitchen. Highly recommend. Some of the best Indian food I've had.",5 
75,"I love Dishoom. Having moved from LA to London and finally getting good Indian food has been such a treat. Dishoom is authentic, delicious, busy (so definitely reserve) and with plenty of options! My kid is allergic to dairy, and their vegan naan was mind blowing- so light and airy and absolutely delicious. The service is wonderful too. Must get their chicken ruby. Never ever disappoints. Honestly, haven't had anything disappointing at any of the locations.",5 
76,"Yes, there will be a line and wait when you arrive (without reservations), but it moves quickly and it's totally worth the wait. All the dishes were full of flavor and cooked to perfection, the chicken tikka is chef's kiss. One of my highlights while in London.",5 
77,They don't take reservation for 2 so we decided to walk in and see how long we could wait. It was actually not bad at all we waited about 20 mins and everything tasted DELICIOUS!!! Service was great too our waiter was super friendly and gave great recommendations! If you're in London I highly highly recommend trying this restaurant.,5 
78,"Amazing food and beverages. Kind and helpful staff. Felt welcome and prices were reasonable. Arrived before the long queue formed so try to arrive before ""normal"" dinner time and you'll probably not have much of a wait. Also ordered delivery once and was well packaged and hot/fresh. Try it, you shan't regret it.",5 
79,Incredible food and ambiance. Just go at off times because the line to get in wraps around the block.,5 
80,"Great food!  Lovely people serving delicious curries.  That is all I had to say, really, but Yelp requires 85 characters.",5 
81,"Went here for lunch while in London on a business trip. Although I didn't have a reservation, I was able to be seated within 15 minutes as it was just me. It was great to see such a busy restaurant.I ordered the Bhel and it was good. Adding some of the chutneys made it even better.The Vada Pau I ordered was hot and fresh. Using the dry chutney and adding the cilantro chutney made this perfect.As I wanted something lighter to balance out the Vada Pau, for my main, I ordered the Kala Channa salad and, with the chaat masala dressing, this item blew me away! What a surprising delight!!!",5 
82,"Nice Dishoom restaurant very similar to the others. I had the Tila-Foi's Malasa Fish, the Covent Garden special, which was really good as the spices complemented the fish instead of covering it, and it was also a pretty big portion.",4 
83,Excellent Indian food in a city that has many options!  My wife and I really enjoyed the mixed appetizer.  She had the prawns and I had lamb - both were very tasty!,4 
84,"Amazing Bombay food with an Irani twist. All the food we had was spot on! Our fav was actually the Murgh Malai (although most people recommend the Ruby Chicken). The Murgh Malai is chicken thigh meat that is juicy, tender, and cooked to perfection (still slightly pink) and tops the ruby chicken imo. It's super flavorful and not your typical chicken thigh. Be sure to order 3-4 items per person, and don't forget the house chai!",5 
85,"One of the best meals of my life. Had the Chicken Ruby and the chicken was so perfectly cooked, it's melts in your mouth. A MUST do in London!!",5 
86,The BEST Indian of my life!! Go for it!!The chicken ruby is the best abs the garlic naan,5 
87,Got a reservation for 5:30 the last time slot before it becomes a wait in line. The lamb was amazing and the kulfi Ice cream too. Came out thoroughly stuffed,4 
88,Best Indian food we've had in ages! Get a reservation early! Highly recommend  spicy fish wrapped in banana leaf w sweet yogurt accompaniment! Excellent black dal and mutter paneer! I wish we could return but as we left the line was out the door and down the street to enter.,5 
89,"Worth the wait in line, which moved surprisingly quickly. Our table sucked but after waiting wasn't going to complain. Service outstanding. Food delicious.",4 
90,"Great food, wonderful ambiance. Great place to take people first trying Indian as well.",5 
91,Everything about Dishoom is amazing! The food is outstanding and the staff is exceptional!,5 
92,"Better to get a reservation or wait while drinking a chai or cocktail and u will get seated. Nice atmosphere, I missed the live music, awesome waiter from Rumania who explained on his knees the menu...I had a solo lunch couldn't taste many dishes. Sauces are very tasty.",4 
93,"Almost not worth writing a review about this place since everyone seems to agree that it is absolutely fantastic! I wish they opened a branch near where we live! When we got there we waited in line outside and I was thinking the food can't b that good... well it is. We order 6 plates for 2 people and we ate almost all of it. We ordered the tiki chicken, the dahl, the samosas, rice, naam, n a lamb entree. It's hard to say which one was best or my favorite everything was delicious!",5 
94,"I came here on recommendation from locals and travel friends. I can't say this was a stand-out place, I've definitely had better, cheaper Indian cuisine in the US. The queue to be seated was very long. They have outdoor heaters to keep sections of the queue warm.",3 
95,"Although I live in Los Angeles, I visit London twenty days ago. This restaurant was recommended by a cab driver, then Yelp confirmed it. My wife and I luckily arrived before a long line of diners formed in front. Our cordial waiter offered some suggestions and we ordered a bit too much food to consume at one sitting but easily warmed up for another meal later. We do have several good Indian eateries in Los Angeles and New York but we enjoyed our meal here very much and we are hoping to return in July to visit again.",5 
96,Amazing dining experience from start to finish and dont even get me started on the food. 2 week vacation all over Europe and this was far and above the best meal we had and frankly the best I've had in a long time.Bravo to the managers and staff and owners for the vision. It's a well oiled machine and yet we felt so taken care of and never rushed. THANK YOU FOR THIS PLACE!,5 
97,Loved it so much we went twice during our last visit to London! Loved the warm up Chai while we were waiting in line! Lovely service both times!!  Great dining experience!! Looking forward to our next visit!!!,5 
98,"I went here its amazing. Food was delicious, whatever we ordered there just arrived on time and it was all pleasantly decorated. Ambience was perfect and the customer support staff were highly accommodating too.",5 
99,"It's difficult to say if it was worth the 90 minutes wait time, but the fact that I am not complaining says enough.The black daal was divine.",5 
100,"Fantastic chicken, beef, and mango lasses. Colaba Colada is also delicious, and good atmosphere.",5 
101,"This place was highly recommended to us which is why we decided to create a reservation. We went at 3pm on a weekday so there was no wait. The servers were extremely friendly and helpful, and the food was absolutely delicious.",5 
102,Great fresh food. Distinctive dishes. Great service. Every dish on the menu is worth trying. And the other reviews are correct - the Chai is wonderful!,5 
103,"Pricy but reasonable and dishes are worth it. Never had anything like these dishes before so I cannot say it is authentic but I know I can taste good food and this was it.Customer service: 4/5 because waitress was slow getting to me but kind when she got to me.Price: 4/5Food: 5/5Sincerely, Cherie",4 
104,"Heard so much about Dishoom before our trip to London, I knew we had to go. We tried twice, first time was 1.5 hours and we couldn't wait. We came back a second time and it was 50 minutes at 10:30 pm. We decided to wait. It was well worth it. The food lives up to the hype and the service was excellent! The garlic naan and cheese naan were amazing. The ruby chicken was perfect. Everything we got was great and we would go back if we are ever in London again. We highly recommend. They take reservations before 6:00 so try to do that if you can!",5 
105,Wow. I haven't had very much Indian in London but this place was out of this world. A super attentive staff and hearty portions. Come hungry.,5 
106,i don't know about this please i reviews by mistake,5 
107,"Probably the best Indian food I've ever had, changed my whole view on the cuisine! Waited about 20 minutes, totally worth it.",5 
108,The server we had was super amazing!  The food did not impress me.  My son like some kind of wrap with everything inside.   We went to another chain Indian restaurant the day before and thought it was way better.   It wasn't memorable to me.  I can't recall what I ate there since I have been home.   We were there in March.   I guess it is worth the try if you don't have to wait in the ridiculous long line.  Definitely not worth the wait if you are from area with Indian towns.   Indian food in Los Angeles area is much better!,4 
109,"Best vfm of Indian cuisine in London. Everything we ordered was tasty. Be ware to ask before, how spicy the dish is...",5 
110,Worth it. Go here. ignore the local haters that say this is for tourists. It's SO SO GOOD.,5 
111,"Dishoom lives up to the hype. We got the lunch feast as a large group (9 people) and the service, though slow, was adequate. Mumbaikars in my party suggested that the Bombay local cuisine was well-represented! Also, one of our party left a jacket and the server chased us down outside to make sure they didn't forget it.",5 
112,"Many of my Indian friends recommended this place. I found one that was walking distance from our hotel as there are many locations. As soon as I saw a line, I immediately knew it was for Dishoom! We got in line and was added in the queue list. We were probably 30 ppl back. I felt the lines moved quickly. The staff team served either lemonade or so while folks were waiting to get in. Once in, our server Alex was very nice (I had to asked for our server name as here, wait staff doesn't seem to introduce themselves much). We ordered few grilled dishes and starters. Everything was amazing to me! It was slightly spicier than what I'm use to, but still very good. Highly recommend!",5 
113,"This restaurant was a great Indian place bustling with so many people. We had to wait in line for about 50 minutes but the line moved pretty quickly considering how long it was. The chicken ruby was delish and the garlic naan was so flavorful. The mashed spicy vegetables were great with a little spice. And it was definitely worth the wait since they handed out little chai teas. This place definitely wins for desserts, the kheer was great, the mango kulfi was so creamy and not too sweet and the cinnamon ice cream tasted like a snickerdoodle cookie!! This was a great place that is only found once in a blue moon. Thanks you dishoom!!",5 
114,"Whenever I told friends I was going to London, they asked ""are you going to Dishoom?!"" So I was thrilled to finally be able to have dinner there! We secured 5:45p reservations (last reservation slot of the day), which allowed us to bypass the lengthy queue that had formed.We were thrilled to be seated by the window with a view of the entire restaurant. Our server was efficient and attentive, and quickly took our drink orders for a delicious Bollybellini and Colaba Colada (highly recommend both!). Food wise, we started with the vegetable samosas that I think were my favorite part of the whole meal!Then we shared garlic naan (they bring 3 dipping sauces), the Chicken Berry Britannia, Chicken Ruby and Kala Chana salad. Despite going with items that weren't marked as ""spicy,"" it's worth noting each item was fairly spicy (we have a low spice tolerance, though). The kala chana salad and naan were a nice reprieve from the heat of our chicken entrees.",5 
115,Great shop and coffee shop ..high prices though but won't stop me returning as a treat maybe a salad garnish with the sausage roll  would make it a more acceptable price was lovely any way just a bit lonely on the plate,5 
116,"Don't get me wrong, the place has good food compared to other Indian inspired restaurants, but the prices and spices were too heavy.1. The chicken ruby curry had too much flavor, and the curry overpowered everything else, which made the dish a spicefiled mess.2. The house special has much similar effects. The sauce was too overflowing with too many flavors, which causes the downfall of the dish.3. The appetizers were actually really tasty. The lamb samosa and shrimp were both delicious, but they were heavily overpriced. On the other hand, okra fries were decent: worth trying, but not great.4. Both the lassis (mango and rose) were too creamy, and not appetizingFor about 100 pounds, this was not a good meal.",3 
117,"I've wanted to try out Dishoom in Covent Garden for a long time now, as one of the most-reviewed businesses on Yelp in London, this is also the original Dishoom which opened back in 2010. It re-opened in 2021 after a refurbishment and the interior looks really good.The restaurant has a nice feel to it, it feels very open and welcoming and matches other Dishoom locations I've visited, I do prefer the interior of their Kings Cross location, however, but this one certainly isn't too bad either. I did find the chairs to be very uncomfortable, being placed on garden chairs - I don't know how they lasted the refurb.I didn't find service to be as good as other stores, no one checked up on me during my meal to ask if everything was okay, this was frustrating especially given the fact they weren't overly busy, and my table was right next to where a couple of staff members were standing - they still put a service charge onto the bill at the end too, adding insult to injury!The food, however, was excellent, I really enjoyed my Chicken Ruby, which has a generous portion of chicken, it was well-spiced and well seasoned, the basmati rice accompanied this really well, and so did the gunpowder potatoes, this delivered possibly the best food I've had during my most recent trip to London.The way the restaurant is designed, it's meant for sharing, this isn't a place you can come on your own for lunch, instead, come with a friend, or perhaps a more romantic setting, order multiple dishes and sides and share, the portion of rice and potatoes, for example, was huge and this would certainly be enough for 2-3 people to have a good portion and leave with a full stomach.PRO TIP: Make a reservation, you can make a reservation for most of the day other than ""evening meal times"", the queues outside can get really long (they have umbrellas waiting), so to avoid being disappointed, it is well worth booking in advance via their online website.4* - Excellent food, a nice interior, but lacklustre service means I will probably be heading to the Kings Cross branch in future.",4 
118,An irani Indian restaurant- so everything is kinda a fusion and taste different from southern Indian or Punjabi restaurants- be prepared for long line wait but worth it - my favorite was Masala fish which is unique to this restaurant,5 
119,"It was fantastic every plate we had was delicious! The Fried Okra (not pictured), Ginger Lemon Tea, Spicy Lamb Chops, Ruby Chicken.",5 
120,"Amazing food quality. Great atmosphere and great waiter. The chili chicken was amazing, the daal was also great, had the chefs special fish which was very flaky  and to compliment the dishes with garlic & butter naan.",5 
121,Such an overrated restaurant. This was highly recommended for our London trip but everything from service to good was just average. We have had better Indian food. Their famous House chat was average. The drink was watered down. The lamb chop was fine. The ruby chicken tasted so industrial . The naan was dry. This was a disappointment.,3 
122,"Wasn't much of an Indian food fan before this restaurant... but this experience changed my whole perception. When we walked up there was a long line but it moved very smoothly and quickly. The waiter was very friendly and extremely helpful in picking out food items and helped give the best experience possible. Would highly recommend the land samosas, keema pou and house fish special.",5 
123,my second time at dishoom and it did not disappoint! here's what we ordered for 2people (and were stuffed afterwards):lamb samosas: 5/5 - the spicy orange sauce is amazingchicken ruby: 4.5/5 - red tomato sauce based curry hit the spot covent garden special fish: 4/5 black daal: 5/5 - never knew lentils could be so yummyrice and garlic naanto note:-rice and naan are not included in mains-we waited 30 min and lined up at 6pm on a weekday; would recommend coming earlier esp on a weekend-they gave us chai to sip while in line; that was,5 
124,Lived up to expectations. A friend who appreciates great food recommended this place and it did not disappoint. As soon as you walk in the smell of the food makes you hungry. Great server who took the time to explain the menu and made recommendations. Okra fries were amazing with a spice we could not identify but we didn't care as we finished it quickly. We also had chili chicken as an appetizer which has a delightful bit of heat. Then we ordered the chicken grill and garlic naan and cheese Non. Both were hot crispy and soft and needed to soak up the sauces. We also ordered the house black DA a L which was really interesting and we stopped up all of it with the naan. And even though we were full we had to order dessert chocolate pudding with chili ice cream and basmati Kheer. The chocolate pudding is the same as a gooey chocolate lava cake and the other desert tasted like a cross between rice pudding and crème brûlée. Both highly recommend we left full but happy. We also ordered the gin gimlet a special which was limey and delicious and we ordered a second round of the same. The only regret is we didn't have more people with us so we could try more dishes.,5 
125,"Best Indian food I have had in my life. Words can describe how much I loved dishoom. If I can come back to London, it will be one of my first stops!",5 
126,Loved this restaurant!  We were in town visiting relatives and somehow managed to get in without waiting 2 hours!  The lamb chops are fantastic!  A Must have!  Would never have thought to order lamp chops in an Indian Restaurant but so glad we did!  Loved them so much we ordered three more plates!  And the chili chicken...an Indian Chinese fusion dish....delicious!  And if you're in the mood for street food...order the chat!,5 
127,"The food quality and service is excellent.  Taste wise, there is a fullness and complexity to the flavorings but nothing overwhelming IMO.  We all liked their curry chicken, bomb potatoes, and naan.  Their somosas were a bit too small.  If you can get in line for a table before 4:30, you should be seated within 15 minutes. This location is very popular and busy.",5 
128,"Loved it! It had a long line when we came but the staff was so sweet and offered everyone chai while we waited. The food and drinks were so so good, definitely recommend!",5 
129,"Service was great and the overall atmosphere was great. We ordered the chicken ruby, tandoori roti, and the garlic naan. We enjoyed the food and the portions were great.",5 
130,"I am obsessed with dishroom, every single thing we got was so delicious and I love the atmosphere. The chai, daal, and cinnamon ice cream were particular favorites. Waitstaff is so nice, they accommodate allergies well, and it's a nice big place so we never had to wait too long . A highlight of our trip",5 
131,Super ambience and tasty food. We were served chai while waiting as well! Definitely worth visiting,5 
132,"Dishoom was AMAZING. Totally lived up to the hype. Food was phenomenal and so reasonably priced, and the service was amazing. Everyone was so kind and really just made it a great experience. Could not recommend more!",5 
133,Exceptional service and delicious food. There was a wait around the corner when we left at 5:30 PM. Definitely make reservations. My only wish is they would pair entrees with a side (or offer a recommendation of side).,4 
134,Honestly the best restaurant I've ever had in my life. Expensive but worth every penny. Staff is wonderful. BBQ is wonderful. Curry is wonderful. Well worth the long line and wait. Enjoy!,5 
135,"We had to wait for 30 minutes to get into Dishoom, but it was worth it. The restaurant passed out cups of chai and green tea for the people waiting in line. The environment was lively, the employees were friendly, and the food was good. The foods labeled ""spicy"" were definitely spicy! If you don't want a lot of spice, I'd recommend getting something that isn't spicy because they give out sauces that you can add to get your desired spice level. We were given cups of chai on the house at the end too. I will be going back!",4 
136,"Best dinner we had in London. There was a short line to get in but it lives faster than expected. The food was excellent, my family and I all loved it.",5 
137,"I was looking for a good place to dine alone before a play and this was perfect. The curry and garlic naan were perfection, the service was fantastic, and the atmosphere is warm and charming.",5 
138,"Dishoom hardly needs another great review, but let me just say that while the food and atmosphere are outstanding, the thing I loved the most was the service. From the moment we stepped into line and we're offered warm chai or sherry, we were treated with such hospitality. Our waitperson Arlind could not have been more gracious or helpful. He gave us excellent advice on which nan or roti would go well with our order and checked on us often throughout our meal. We felt like old friends by the time we left. Dining at Dishoom was an incredible experience. Can't wait to come again!",5 
139,"Perfect lunch in London! I was searching for the restaurant near the Covent Garden and It was successful. Two dishes are a little heavy for me though, each of the dishes which I got recommended was fantastic! I will be back :)",5 
140,"Ok, I know everyone is basically obsessed with this place, I mean the line starts at around 5 or 6 and goes back for a block... although they do come out and give sips of something. We came early and got seated pretty quickly and although the food was great for those in our family that love hot/spice, it was everything else that just made this feel so over rated for me. The air conditioning was broken (literally during a heat wave in London with the highest temperatures EVER) and then their oven was broken so they would come very 15 minutes or so and tell us they were on again and then off again. We all got food at different times and that was pretty lame, and it was just overall pretty uncomfortable. I definitely was not a fan but my husband and kids have already been back twice.",4 
141,Really impressed. The food is exceptional and the service is also extremely good. Huge fan of the style of the restaurant and I have made sure to regularly visit the various locations.,5 
142,the most authentic Indian restaurant in London by far. Every dish we had was amazing and reminded me of my home country. Also the atmosphere and vibe is real special. I've gone countless times and have never had a bad meal of substandard service..,5 
143,"Delicious!  Had the okra fries and samosas, chicken ruby and house black daal- yum!  Okra fries are a can't miss!",5 
144,Some of the best Indian food I've had around let alone vegetarian's food I only wish they had it where I live!,5 
145,"Good food (but be prepared for spiciness!!!) but ridiculous long lines, and the restaurant couldn't really keep up with cleanliness due to the volume of customers. Loud with lots of big tables for groups, but not ideal for couples.",4 
146,Great place for Indian food. Fantastic value and lots of choices - always visit here when in london,5 
147,Very beautiful and big place. Loved the food. Service was great.It was a lineup make sure to book before you go.,5 
148,"Just wow. Can't go wrong here. I'm Indian I would know. Great chicken ruby, seekh kebab, vegetable samosa, chole puri, and everything is shareable. Lots to try here!",5 
149,There was so much hype around this restaurant but fell short on most counts. The waiters/waitresses were actually very nice and seemed to have some knowledge about Indian food. The decor was nice but the food was a huge letdown. The chilli chicken was unnecessarily spicy. I love spice but this was just ridiculous. The chaat was nothing special (I've had way better) and the chickpea curry as well as the daal were mediocre. If you have had Indian food before I have no idea how people are writing that this food is good - absolutely not worth the price or the wait in line. Sorry.,3 
150,"Dishoom is my favorite restaurant and I love this location. I've eaten here several times and have never been disappointed. Most recently I visited for breakfast and got the egg roll naan and it was a great start to the day! I also really love their mattar paneer, jackfruit biryani, paneer tikka, and the house chaat. Love to get these dishes and all share at the table!",5 
151,"The Boundary  Street has its own lovely character.  If the weather is nice, and even if it is not so nice, relaxing on the verandah sipping the house chai is a treat. The food is excellent and not to be missed-- not your usual Indian food. Don't miss the porridge or the breakfast naan dishes. The hostesses and wait staff go above and beyond, including helping us get an Uber in the middle of a massive heat wave. We will definitely be here again on our next trip to Londond",5 
152,"It's the best food, period, I've ever had. I love Indian flavors, but this was above and beyond. The black daal, butter chicken, fried okra, lassi, the 0 proof drinks (teetotaler), everything! We stayed in London for 4 days and ate at Dishoom once every day (brunch, lunch and dinner).",5 
153,Great food! The black dahl is our favourite.,5 
154,This restaurant was recommended by a friend and I had no idea what to expect. As soon as you walk in you're filled with an exciting vibe. We got drinks at the bar while waiting for our table and then ordered the best things. Ask your waiter for recommendations,5 
155,"Lisa, our server, guided us well on our food order. She was VERY pleasant and friendly--always has a smile for everyone. We're more than pleased with the food but more so with Lisa's service!If it's your first time at this place also, you could try our order: Masala Fish, Chicken Ruby, and Black Daal with roti and rice as accompaniment.",5 
156,This place was so worth the hour wait!!!!  The menu is perfect for trying new dishes and sharing with family.  The freshly baked naan bread is addictive.   Dishoom is a must try while in London.,5 
157,Would recommend to anyone visiting London! The food and service were both amazing. We asked the waiter what was good and he just about circled everything on the menu.,5 
158,"Good quality ingredients & very authentic flavors! Dishoom is one of my favorite Indian restaurants in London & I think about them often while I'm back in the states. While Carnaby can be a little overwhelming on certain days, you can always find a cozy (yet lively) escape in Dishoom's thoughtfully designed space. Great cocktails, good service & food that is always worth the wait!",4 
159,"One of the BEST Indian restaurants we've gone too. When visiting England, we make it a priority to eat there. Went to the one in Manchester this time, as well. Very cool building and vibe. The wait can be long, but worth it! Food comes out timely, servers are great and helpful.",5 
160,"This place is amazing. So good we went twice on our trip around the UK. Tons of great options, loved the ruby chicken, black dala, and pineapple tiki. We had two vegetarians w us and they had great options for them.",5 
161,The best Indian ever. Get the black daal and don't forget the old fashioned. Delicious!,5 
162,"Heard a lot about Dishoom but when came to this location, I was disappointed to see -1- Very limited selection of vegetarian appetizers2-  a single curry option for vegetarians3- waitress forgot to tell us about the vegetarian dal option, which was not listed on menu but was available4- Romali roti was burnt, hard and not Romali at all!We orderedHouse bhel- it was certainly innovative and tasted ok.Bhel- I was given the dry mix and the 3 separate sauces- garlic, tamarind and mint. I did not get the bhel experience: sauces tasted fine separately thoughPaneer tikka was at the most mediocre!Matar  paneer - As the only vegetarian curry option, I want this to be spectacular- this was anything but that! The spices left a bitter aftertaste!!!House black dal - there was less dal and a similar spice gravy like there is in matar paneer. It had extreme amount of butter- did not taste good or authentic!Jackfruit biryani- overcooked mushy rice which tasted sour and nothing like biryani!Pros- the only 2 reasons for 2 stars are:Nans were goodPaneer was freshI do hope that Dhishum does something to cater vegetarian population too.Unfortunately this didn't work for me or my family!!",2 
163,"Kicking off our first international trip with the kids, we landed in London at some point in the afternoon, took the Underground to Covent Gardens, dropped off all our stuff at our apartment, and headed off to explore. The line for Dishoom caught our attention so I started waiting for a table, half dazed from the long flight but also trying to read our travel guidebook, while my wife and kids wandered off to look around.After about an hour we were seated and had one of our favorite meals of the trip. The kids still talk about the chicken ruby, which has set the standard for any sort of Indian chicken dish that they eat. The chicken is tender, and the flavorful sauce is a brilliant red color ( yelp.com/user_local_phot… ), which I might have missed if I hadn't obnoxiously used my camera flash to light it up (sorry everyone else who was sitting downstairs). We also got the chicken biryani and green vegetables, as well as some potatoes. Given that we were celebrating our first night in London, we let the kids order some fancy drinks.The restaurant has a very trendy and lively atmosphere. We sat downstairs where it was a little dark and packed with people. The wait staff were nice, even when asking me to please stop taking photos of my food with the flash. A very memorable meal for us and well worth the wait.",5 
164,"Food, drinks, & service were a 10/10. The best Indian food I've ever had! I especially loved the décor.",4 
165,"We are ended up here because we had flown in from San Francisco, it was getting late, there was a protest paralyzing parts of the area and we found this spot on Yelp. What an amazing turn of events. Other than the food taking a long time to come out, everything else about this spot was perfect. Spicy pork chops, chicken ruby, okra were all awesome dishes. What I just woke up still thinking about, however, was the Chefs Covent Garden Special. Sea Bream marinated in Marsala with other spices--it was simply one of the best things I've ever eaten--anywhere.",5 
166,"Was not disappointed, best Indian food we've had to date. Hoping they eventually open a spot back in LA!!",5 
167,"There is a reason this is one of the top rated restaurants in London. The food, service, and atmosphere were all amazing. Absolutely my top recommendation in London.",5 
168,Honestly we came here without a reservation. Waited in a huge line that I never thought would never end. But it was super quick and it was completely worth the wait. Definitely the best food I've had in London. We had a great time and really one of the best dining experiences I've had. Cheers!,5 
169,"The place is well designed and the service is good. But the food is nothing special, for lbdon at least. A good place to go with colleagues or acquaintances for a light meal that will be inoffensive to all.",3 
170,Some of the best Indian food I have ever had. Classic food yet unique at the same time. If you are in London this restaurant is a must!,5 
171,"Far and away the best Indian food I have ever had, and the best food I had while in London. Everything was incredible and I ate after I was full because I physically couldn't stop myself from doing so. The gunpowder potatoes, lamb samosas, chicken ruby, and chicken tikka were my favorites and if I'd ordered the whole menu they all would likely be my favorites. This was our first time here and when the waiter recommended so many dishes I was somewhat skeptical but I now wish I'd ordered twice as many because nothing was disappointing and I can only imagine the second half of the menu is as good as the half we ordered!",5 
172,"I was in London 3 nights and I came here twice. Then I bought the cookbook. So hopefully this should dispel any doubts as to whether Dishoom is worth the wait--because it absolutely is.  The food blew my mind and I easily had one of the greatest meals of my life.  If you are in London you seriously need to make a point of going to one of the Dishoom locations. (Note: This location is currently closed until summer 2020.)Things to get (in order of necessity):Chicken Ruby - maybe my favorite thing I've ever eaten. I ate every last drop of it with my garlic naan. Do not come here without ordering this.Pau Bhaji- I'm not exactly sure what is in this other than potatoes and perfect spices but it is wonderful. The warm buttery buns it comes with go perfectly with it. This is another must order.Chocolate pudding with spiced ice cream - You'll probably be so full by the time you hit dessert that you will want to pass on it. Don't do that. This is unreal. The chocolate is so rich and flavorful and it tastes absolutely perfect with the spiced ice cream.Black Daal - so full of flavors yet so buttery and rich. I could've just eaten this as a meal. I added enjoyed dipping the Okra fries in this.Garlic Naan - Great, but not particularly special. necessary to eat every last drop of Chicken Ruby and Pau Bhaji.Dishoom Slaw Super refreshing when eaten with all the other dishes!Okra Fries - seasoned perfectly and lightly fried. These were a great change of texture compared to everything I've mentioned above.Pass:Chicken biryani - kind of plain. perfectly fine, but unnecessary. Gunpowder potatoes - Good, but nothing special.Quick note about the wait. You can make reservations for breakfast and lunch. If you go for dinner you have to wait in line. The first time I went they told us the wait was 1.5 hours and it ended up being more like 1. The second time, they said 1 hour and it was about 30 mins. Seriously, don't let the line scare you!  They also pass out green tea, chai, and sherry while you wait.",5 
173,Great food. I personally love Chilli chicken here but most of the menu is tasty. friendly people and excellent service,5 
174,"The absolute best meal we had during our recent stay in London. The wait for a table was long, but made bearable by the samplings of chai and warmed sherry we were offered. Our party of five ordered at least a quarter of the menu to share and not a single item disappointed. The highlights we all agreed were the Pau Bhaji and Black Daal -absolutely delicious.",5 
175,"I was beyond excited to try the infamous Dishoom, but unfortunately, it didn't live up to the hype for me. My friend and I came here for breakfast. I ordered the Bombay Breakfast and a Bacon and Egg Naan Wrap. -Bombay Breakfast: nothing special, an Indian-inspired version of the English breakfast. Everything was good. -Bacon and Egg Naan: this was a big disappointment. Sounded delicious on the menu, but tasted overly sweet. Mine barely had any bacon, which would've cut the chutney inside. Maybe it's a better choice for dinner? I'll be back someday to give it another go.",3 
176,Average food poorly presented Waste of time and money There seems to be no effort going into creating something really good,2 
177,Surprisingly tasty restaurant.  Very cool environment and lay out on the upstairs of the building.  The food is meant to be shared and is very well made.,4 
178,Great Indian food ! In the heart of London ! Service was exceptional too. Kebabs were my favorite,5 
179,The wait is staggering and its not exactly traditional indian that you would expect. The bar was amazing and the drink were perfect so its a great social space. Good for a few rounds but its crowded with guests waiting for a seat.,3 
180,Great food! Loved the butter chicken and loved the daal! Highly recommend! I also really liked the service and the whole theme of the restaurant is so cool and creative,5 
181,! Is Dishoom Michelin star? This was my question while enjoying my tasty food there !,5 
182,One of my favorite restaurants.  Some of the best Indian food in a really cool space.  Waitstaff and hosts are friendly.,5 
183,One of the best Indian restaurants in london. The black dal and butter chicken are amazing dishes as well as the fried okra. The staff were super nice too,5 
184,"From the moment we arrived I loved the place.  The building, the location, and the interior are all tastefully done, and the staff who greeted us at the door were great! The food was delicious, the chai was as well.  Having the water in tiffin cups is a nice touch! We will definitely return,and we will save room for dessert next time.",5 
185,"Waited 75-90 minutes and it was surprisingly worth it just for that Ruby Chicken. Service was good and they really helped make that wait a little more tolerable with the free chai and Sherry.Food: The main standout dish was the Ruby chicken, and everything else was good but not amazeballs.+ Ruby chicken: Essentially the best butter chicken you'll ever have. Tomato based do slight sweet creamy tang.+ Black Dahl: good and buttery. + Lamb biryani: Good but very spicy to me. Pretty normal.+ Garlic naan: good but could have had more pieces+ Mixed veggies: surprisingly good. It's snow peas, broccoli, and kale.+ Mango lassi: good but could have had more as wellOverall, for the price and wait I expected a little more, but it was a solid restaurant. Would I wait again? Probably not unless it was 30 minutes.",4 
186,Dishoom is amazing. That is all. Love the Covent Garden reno!,5 
187,"Amazing food & experience. A bit pricy, but fair for the experience you get.  Only downside is they don't take reservations, so you need to queue.",5 
188,Incredible service. Flavors are amazing. Best Indian food I have ever had. Good idea to get a reservation,5 
189,"Amazing food! Well worth the wait outside, during which time complimentary taster drinks are offered. Each dish is better than the last. We have been here during two separate visits to London and have not been disappointed.",5 
190,"My foodie son who travels to London monthly said Dishoom is by far his favorite restaurant. He texted me daily to ask if I had eaten there yet!We stopped by at different times and it was always a 1 hour wait to get in. We finally stood in line and waited. Yes, it was worth it!It was intimidating to look at the menu and only recognize the name of 1 or 2 items, but our waiter was extremely helpful in his recommendations and descriptions of his favorites.This is what our party of 4 ordered and shared:Pau Bhaji (it's similar to chili. Served with small rolls)Chilli Chicken - crispy  spicy garlicky pieces of chicken  Lamb Boti Kabob - seasoned & grilled lamb (excellent!)House Black Daal - mild, creamy lentils, it's like a stewChicken Ruby - 2 pieces of chicken in red sauce Chicken Britannia Biryani Bowl (a favorite)Naan (2 orders)Basmati rice (2 orders)Everything was excellent. Service was outstanding!",5 
191,"Update- I phoned the restaurant yesterday and there customer service has improved but still have not gave me a refund, the food was overpriced and I will definitely not be going back after my experience.",2 
192,"Found this place online, was in London for one day and after having a wonderful English breakfast I had to come for more. Returned the same evening for dinner without a reservation and was accommodated. Dinner was incredible and the service even better. Highly recommend!",5 
193,"This may be the best Indian food I have ever had. We were quickly seated in a cozy table in the lower level, and the waiter was extremely helpful in explaining the spice levels of each dish, their signature picks, what he recommends to get with what, etc. Even though the menu is quite large, he helped us narrow down our picks.Murgh Malai: These chicken thighs were extremely tender and exploding with rich seasonings. A blackened crust on the outside forms a layer of purely blissful taste that gives way to the moist, soft thigh meat underneath. Fantastic dish!Chicken Ruby: We were told this is their most popular dish. It is very smooth and the tomato really stands out.Black Daal: Probably my favorite dish here (it's close between this and Murgh Malai). It's savory, buttery, rich, and intensely flavorful. I would be totally satisfied if I had this and some naan for my meal.Mutton Pepper Fry (Covent Garden special): Moderately spicy, and oh so good. The spices really bring everything else to life, and gives your meal the kick it needs. The mutton is very tender and the sauce really penetrates the meat. It comes with delicious parathi bread.Garlic Naan: Even the naan is amazing at Dishoom. Amazing garlic-y flavors- soft, fresh, and doughy.Mango Lassi: Best mango lassi I have ever had. It tasted extremely fresh, and the fennel seeds added more complexity to the taste. I downed this pretty quickly...One thing I love about this place is that the portion sizes are small. You can choose to go cheap and just get a daal and rice/naan, or you can splurge and try many things. Another thing I love is that every dish is outstanding. You really can't go wrong, and with a menu this big you can keep coming back and discovering new things. Also this place is VERY AFFORDABLE. A+ in every regard.Food: 10/10Service: 10/10Ambience: 10/10Value: 10/10",5 
194,"Best dinner ever ! Came to dishoom with high expectations and still it wowed us. Pav bhaji , veg biryani and ruby chicken and banana leaf fish - it was great food. Need to make reservation before 5:45 pm for same day otherwise 30 min wait but queue moved fast.",5 
195,Came for brunch and was very impressed with their covid precautions and service! Unlimited chai refills were amazing. I ordered the Akuri and house chai. Both were excellent! Very friendly staff and beautiful restaurant.,5 
196,Great food.  Small plates were delicious.  Friendly server.  Complimentary tea and dessert!We are coming back.,3 
197,"Found Dishoom during a trip to London and decided to chance with our 9 year old twins who are exploring Indian food. It was an amazing dinner! Awesome service, fantastic drinks and excellent food. Our kids enjoyed their meals and we learned some new dishes to try at home. A great way to end a London holiday and highly recommend.",5 
198,"Ok, I don't really fancy Indian food but my god Dishoom was good! Where else are people willing to wait 45 min in 35 degree weather just to get seated?! Dishoom came recommended by a few people who have been to London so I knew I had to check it out! TLDR: get the Naan, the chicken ruby (similar time butter chicken) and the black lentil daal. The chicken is super tender, the naan is perfectly crispy and flavored and the overall atmosphere is perfect for a small group of friends :)",4 
199,"Always delicious and a great dining experience whether in the restaurants, delivery at home, or one of their make at home meal kits. Consistently great quality and service.",5 
200,"London is known for it's amazing Indian food and there are tons of Indian restaurants all over the city. This place was recommended by a few friends and the crazy Yelp reviews made me want to try this place during my trip to London. I made reservations prior to my trip for lunch on a Friday. We got here 15 minutes before noon (our reservation time) and were immediately seated. At that time the wait for others was around 30 minutes. When we left the place, there was already a line outside. The service was amazing and our waiter was very attentive and friendly. Here is what we ordered:- Bhel: delicious. Loved that it was not soaked in tamarind chutney. - Okra Fries: loved it!!! Wasn't sure what to expect but these were seasoned perfectly and we finished it off in no time. - Paav Bhaji: loved it!!!! The bhaji was so well cooked and the bread was fresh and toasted to perfection. - House Daal: soooo good!!! I was so full with the other food that I couldn't finish the daal. As I'm writing this review, I'm craving that daal. Yes it was yummy. - Roomali Roti: this was a bit dry. In India these are so soft that they melt on your mouth. This one turned dry as it got cold. - House Chai: perfect for a cold day. It was a bit sweet for my taste but so delicious. My hubby got Murg Malai and said it was as good as what you get in India. Overall I'm a huge fan of this place and would love to come back and try their other dishes. Would I wait an hour to eat here?? No - as there are tons of amazing Indian restaurants in London. Make a reservation and enjoy the food.",4 
201,We had tried to come here for dinner the night before and there was a line all the way down the street. We knew we had to try this place so we made a reservation for the next day during lunch. The inside is so cute and it's huge. We were not sure what to order and our waiter was very helpful and suggested a bunch of things and said sharing everything would be best. This was the best Indian food I have had and we ordered the perfect amount of food. The prices are great too. I definitely suggest this place to anyone!,5 
202,Delicious whether dine in or carry out. Great service as well; one of my favorite Indian restaurants in London.,5 
203,"After eating here I can understand why people stand in line at every location of this mini chain st all hours of the day and night. Really fab Indian food. The queue is no joke. They quoted 1.5 hours for two people on a Saturday night. It goes fast and you can enjoy a complimentary chai or sherry while you wait. It's a bit deceiving because getting to the front of the line gets you only as far as a seat at the bar where you get a pager and wait some more. Eventually you make it to the table.Servers are friendly and food comes out pretty quickly. We loved the black daal, garlic naan, chili broccoli salad (it has a kick!), and veg curry. I didn't love the pineapple that came with the grilled paneer  cheese- the flavor combo just didn't work for me. Roti bread- think fresh made tortilla- was ok, but not worth 3.20£ for a single piece and not as good as the garlic naan. Would recommend, but plan ahead for the wait time.",4 
204,"Our wait was about 90 mins, which included 3 different types of lines. I will say the restaurant does a fabulous job of helping with the long waits with bringing around chai and drinks. We chatted with others in line so it went by pretty quickly. It was also a Saturday evening in the middle of the summer so we expected long waits. After we were seated, we ordered chicken tikka, chicken tikka wrap, Dahl, Chile chicken, sauces with chips, naan and butter chicken. Overall hits and misses. While the food was delicious I expected a bit more because of the hype and the fact that it's Indian food in London. Chicken tikka: 3 stars. I expected the creamy gravy based dish I always order at Indian restaurants however that wasn't the case here. It's dry and too salty for me. Chicken tikka role: 3 stars. It's ehh. Best part is the bread which you can order on the side Dahl: 2 stars. I think this was the worst. Tasted burntChile chicken: 4.5 stars. Best dish of the night Butter chicken: 4 stars. Standard but delicious Naan: 2.5 stars. Burnt and hard. Red flag. Not worth the hype in my opinion but maybe I just have different tastes.",3 
205,"This is a well-run restaurant with great food. I had to wait 20 min for a table, but once I was seated, the service was superb.  My server was extremely knowledgeable and helpful to me as I navigated the menu.  I had the matter paneer, garlic nan, and a small broccoli salad; all were remarkable.  I couldn't find a single fault with Dishoom, and I doubt that you will either.",5 
206,"The line was long but SO worth it!  First experience with Indian cuisine and Richard, our server, was not only informative but gave us lovely recommendations that did not disappoint!!  Can't wait to come back to London to try again!!",5 
207,"I wanted to LOVE this place after waiting on line for an hour to get in. First time I've ever done that, and likely the last! But alas, the food was just okay.-5 stars for service. they served hot masala chai to all who were lined up on the sidewalk. Even seconds if you wanted it. And waitstaff was courteous and attentive. I did hear my server making the SAME recommendation over and over for the house special (and he told me I shouldn't get lamb), but sometimes they push what they want to sell.-4 stars for decor and ambience. Upstairs is brighter, louder and more expansive, while downstairs is dark and cozy. Almost too dark - me and others had to use flashlights on our phones to see the menu. However  it is a bit romantic down there. bathrooms are nice too.-3.5 for food. I ordered fried okra for an appetizer and some kind of chicken for a main. Both were salty and neither were particularly pleasing to my palate. I was warned the chicken came with no sauce but still expected them to be juicy since they were chicken thighs. wrong!I may have enjoyed the experience more had I chosen different things to eat, but that's my struggle with extensive Indian menus (trying to pick something) so  I play it safe.Rating would be a 3.5 if not for great service.",4 
208,"Awesome food! I made a reservation at 5.30 PM. But if you come for lunch, there was no wait.I walked by around 8-9ish PM, they had long line, it started around 5.30 PM. So reservation at 5.30 PM recommended.We ordered the black daal, cheese naan, rice, chicken tikka, and chicken ruby. All are amazing! Taste is on point and we left happy.",5 
209,"Dishoom is a must visit when in London. I've visited two different locations on recent trips & the meal has been a highlight of my vacation both times. Dishoom is just an experience.The space is beautifully designed and decorated in a way where every element is interesting. The lighting, the colors, the textures create an old Hollywood ambiance with a touch of vintage glam. The staff is incredibly friendly and accommodating, they want you to be there and have an amazing meal. They will walk you through the menu and help your meal cater to your liking. The food is absolutely amazing. Out of this world. Authentic flavors. Crave-able, legendary dishes. I can't recommended this restaurant more. Tip: request a table by the kitchen and titular be captivated by the chefs working their magic.",5 
210,"The first time we tried to get into Dishoom we found a line of people 30-40 deep and decided to go elsewhere. We decided for our second attempt to book reservations at a less busy lunch hour. This was totally worth the two attempts to get in. The good was excellent, the service was great, and the ambience was classy and relaxed. This is one of the best Indian meals I had outside of India. I highly recommend.",5 
211,Delicious Indian food. Authentic and tasty with a varied menu. No compromises on flavour and spices.,5 
212,Fantastic Indian food. Not your typical fare in the best possible way. Will be back again on this trip and all future trips.,5 
213,"It's official: My favorite Indian restaurant I have ever tried!* * * EXPERIENCE * * *Made a reservation two months in advance for one person at 12:15pm. I highly recommend anyone wanting to try this place out making a reservation, by the time I arrived at around noon the line was very long, it's centrally located in a busy area which explains why. Inside the restaurant it's got a hip vibe, pretty lively and everyone was enjoying their time. There were so many choices on the menu I really wanted to try out everything, my server was super helpful to help me narrow down some choices. * * * FOOD * * *Chicken Ruby: AIt's hard to describe this dish, I just knew it's extremely tasty! It's slightly sweet, a bit spicy but was edible for me, and the rest there was just lots of unknown spices in it, with some basil and tomato notes. The chicken was very tender.House Black Daal: AIt's less spicy than chicken ruby, there were beans in it, and that's all I know how to describe it, I guess I don't have enough vocabulary to describe Indian dishes, all I knew was it's super yummy.Roti: ADon't forget this most important dish in order to dip into the two sauces above. The texture was very soft, there's some grilled taste to it and there's not really any other flavor to it, which was on point because I could truly enjoy the sauces flavor without distraction.Dishoom is a restaurant I must go back whenever I have a chance to visit London again!",5 
214,The food is alright.  Wait staff is so rude. There are better Indian restaurants out there.,1 
215,"1750 Yelp reviews. All good so we had to eat here when we were in London. Wouldn't wait an hour on line anywhere to eat so we ate here for lunch. You check in upstairs. Apparantly you can make reservations here for lunch. We were sent downstairs to wait by the bar. The entire downstairs was packed. 15 minutes passed and our beeper went off. No seats available upstairs so we ate downstairs. Tables are very close to each other. Our waiter was very friendly and helped us order. We had vegetable samosa, side of vegetables (broccoli, kale and green beans), raita, rice, nan and chicken.  All the food here is very good.  Would return (for lunch hahaha)",4 
216,absolutely amazing! the fish special at the covent garden location is so flavorful and authentic. love the unique atmosphere and interior decor. great job,5 
217,"Best restaurant visited during our time in London.  Don't be discouraged by the line, it moves quick and is worth the wait.  Friendly staff and very enjoyable family style meal. To quote our server.. you will leave full and happy.  Indian food that you will be familiar with in addition to selections that were new to us.",5 
218,Expect a wait. But worth every minuteA line forms every day so expect a 40min to hour wait (can make a reservation if Party is 6 or more).Environment is happening and there is wonderful aromas everywhere. We had the mutton pepper fry which was tender with amazing complex flavors. We didn't want this dish to end. We also had the lamb both kabob (not on a skewer which surprised) and the chicken ruby. It was all amazing. This is a top 5 restaurant experience and a must if in London.,5 
219,Delicious food and you get a lot. I went here for breakfast and the service was great,5 
220,"Came here because I love Indian food and was not disappointed, but would not rate it as highly if I had to wait more than 45 minutes.I was surprised that at 2pm on a Monday there was already a line. Luckily they served the folks waiting in line lemonade for the first waiting area on the street.  Once we were moved into the final waiting area downstairs in front of the bar, we were a little disappointed that we couldn't order a drink.  We literally just sat there until we were called. Once that wait was over, we were seated in the top floor and were met by our server quickly.  We ordered the Rose and Cardamom Lassi, Aflatoon's colada, and the Fresh Nimbu Soda, which were unique and delicious.  For food, the Black Daal, Spicy Lambchops, Samosas, Chicken Ruby and Garlic Naan were our go to selections.  Everything was incredible except for the Black Daal, it was surprisingly bland.  All in all, great service, great food, but would definitely make a reservation instead of waiting next time.",4 
221,"Dishoom was bookmarked on my collection for quite sometime now. I was finally able to try this place during my last visit to London. It was simply one of the best meals we've had during our time in London. We liked it so much that we we went back there twice to try their breakfast and lunch menu as well. The food is genuinely authentic and to a wonderful quality. Everything is well made and you should work your way through the menu. The Okra fries, Chili cheese toast are definitely worth trying. Their mutter paneer, ruby curry accompanied with garlic naan/roti was a good mix, great for vegetarians as well. Fantastic food, make sure you make a reservation because there's always a line. But it looked like they had chai for those waiting when it was cold. They take no customer for granted and want to make you feel at home. We also got some chai on the house at the end, which really felt as a great way to finalize our already amazing dinner experience. Food, drinks and service were perfect! Goes without saying it's probably one of the best Indians in town. Covent Garden branch definitely better than others. Highly recommended!PS: They sell their own coins which is quite cute. It's blessed by queen's treasury. :)",5 
222,"Black dal, Ruby chicken and chilli chicken are uncomparable.  Every cocktail we tried was fantastic as well. Will keep coming back regularly!",5 
223,"Everything was amazing but if you don't try the chicken ruby, you're not living your best life. This place is well worth the money. I'd eat here very often if I lived nearby.",5 
224,"It looked more like a store than a restaurant from outside and it definitely was a rather noisy atmosphere inside. The menu was however big and we ordered a lot of different dishes to share at the table. Everything was delicious, except for the ""shaved ice"" which the waiter did warn us was a thing that not all would like. We thought we wanted the adventure and tried it anyway. :) The drinks were also amazing with many alcohol free options. I will absolutely come back again!",4 
225,This was #1 on my London Food Tour list and it didn't disappoint. When we walked up we noticed the long line *ahem* que but saw that it was going quickly. The hostess passed out warm chai which was the best I've ever tasted. We loved talking to the locals while we waited. Great experience and we hadn't even walked through the doors. This place has the best ambience. Plan your London tour around Dishoom!,5 
226,"I came with great anticipation with friends who always rave about this restaurant.  It did not deliver. The food was good, but I expected awesome.  The service was terrible.  Our drinks came well after our food arrived.  We ordered rice which came after the meal was almost completed.  Our second orders of food never came and our server disappeared for 30 minutes.  While I suspect staffing shortages were apart of the challenges, for the price and expectation, I would not recommend this restaurant.",1 
227,"I went here on the recommendation of a friend originally from India, so I had pretty high expectations. Dishoom lived up to them and more. The food was all incredibly flavorful and I am already planning to attempt a recreation of the black daal at home because it was that good.Prices are a bit high, but at the same time pretty reasonable for London. My husband and I shared the daal, chicken tikka, naan, rice and bowl of greens and it was a bit too much food for lunch (I should probably note we're both not huge eaters, so if you have a large appetite this would probably be more suitable) and therefore I'd recommend ordering one item with a side or two first and adding on as needed, at least if you're returning to a hotel with no refrigerator for leftovers as we were!",5 
228,"We enjoyed Dishoom for dinner so much that we needed to get another taste before we left London. As our flight is in the afternoon, we opted for breakfast. This time we went to Dishoom at Covent Garden. The opened at 9 and we were the third table to sit. By 9:30, the room was pretty much filled. We ordered the big Bombay (which is essentially their version of the English breakfast), the keema per eedu, and the famous bacon naan roll. Oh and chai as well. The chai isn't as sweet as the typical ones we get which was great. It was quite delicious. I thoroughly enjoyed the big Bombay and keema as well. These are hearty breakfast choices of course but the better ones in my opinion. The bacon naan was good but not as amazing as I thought it would be.Overall the breakfast was a success and I'm in love with their spicy chutney. The dinner menu is better but I wasn't disappointed with breakfast either.",4 
229,"We came here on multiple recommendations of friends who live in London & others who have visited. They don't let you book a reservation for parties less than 6 for dinner so be prepared to wait a long time for dinner unless you come before their rush (I.e. before 6:30pm). We arrived around 7:30pm and told there was an hr and a half wait (it was accurate). They make the line enjoyable enough with offerings of delicious chai tea and mint tea while you wait. It is very rare that I would line up for an hr and a half for anything (unless I'm at Disneyland) but all the recommendations made me think this was food worth waiting for. It certainly was. We asked the waiter for his recommendations & explanations of the menu. He was very knowledgeable and helpful. We ordered the vegetable samosas to start. Thankfully after the long line we didn't have to wait long to actually receive our food. The samosas were remarkably complex in flavors and the accompanying sauces were a perfect compliment to them. We ordered the Chicken Ruby, Black Daal and Paneer Tikka with Roti. I honestly don't know how to describe them. I was so lost in the flavors and the experience, I'm left speechless. I have to note that often I've had paneer in a curry and I've found it akin to tofu, seeming to lack in flavor. Not so at Dishoom. The paneer is grilled and packed with flavor especially combined with the pineapple and a squeeze of lime. This is a meal that will threaten your good table manners and make you want to pick up your plate and lick it clean. We couldn't leave without dessert so we finished the meal off with the Gulab Jamun (a dumpling with citrus ice cream) and the Malai Kulfi (like an ice cream stick with a light caramel flavor). I ordered the Gulab Jamun and was amazed at the flavor combo. I wasn't sure about having a dumpling with citrus ice cream but the flavors married perfectly. I tried to come up with things to compare the dumpling to give you an image but nothing suffices. Just order it and thank me later. The ambience was lovely. The interior is beautiful and well designed. Bonus: if you get to sit near the kitchen, it is entertaining to watch the chefs make the naan. They make it look so easy! I would come back here and wait in that line again any day.",5 
230,"Love this place!Came here with another two friends. We got in line at 6pm and got in at about 715pm on a Saturday evening. This is indeed a popular restaurant!All three sauces they have were good! They suited different dishes though.Got lamb samosa which was great, and the spicy sauce nailed it. The chicken curry was great, so as the grilled shrimp. Those were a little on the spicy side but soooooo yummy! The garlic naan and the grilled chicken were decent, but I was not a fan of the other vegetable curry.Overall I love the dishes here! Good service and environment too!",5 
231,Was recommended Dishoom by a couple of friends and it definitely lived up to the hype! The chicken ruby was outstanding and the drinks were delicious. Try the old fashioned - you won't regret it. Will be recommending this spot to anyone who visits London!,5 
232,"We've heard that everyone loves Dishoom and queues up for it. It was very good, luckily we made a reservation so we didnt have to wait in the rain. Its crowded and loud but the service was excellent and the food was delicious, well presented and good value. We went with the prawns in coconut milk, lamb kebabs and chili chicken.   Chili chicken was a big like gen tsos with curry very tasty but spicy. The lamb kebabs were good but i would skip them next time.  The prawns were in fabulous sauce & I highly recommend! We had the mango kulfi for dessert Yum! All in all not a place to linger as they set the time at your table but very good food.",4 
233,"Dishoom is absolutely worth every bit of the hype and then some!  Dishoom does not take reservations for small groups, and there is upwards of almost a two hour wait during busy times.  Hubby and I were able to be seated with only a 30 minute wait at 2:30p for a late lunch.The food is incredible.  Served as small plates family style, Hubby and I ordered:- Okra Fries - crunchy sticks of fried okra in a light batter- Chicken Tikka - Grilled and wonderful when paired with a curry- Black Daal - Black lentil puree to be used as a sauce and a dishoom speciality- Chicken Ruby - The B.E.S.T. curry ever- Garlic Naan - Enough to sop up all of the curry- Chai tea - served warm in a bottomless cup until 5:00p with the perfect amount of spices- Old Fashion - with a kick of cayenne pepper- Pistachio Kulfi - Ice cream on a stickThe service was warm and attentive, but not overbearing.  The prices were a little high, but well worth it.  It was our best meal in London.",5 
234,"Excellent food and service. The lines are long, but once you have the opportunity to dine there you will understand why.",5 
235,"Outstanding Indian cuisine located in the heart of London, just north of Picadilly Circus. Came here on a Thursday afternoon for a late lunch - reservations are a must. RESTAURANT: Two floors with a bar downstairs for waiting and casual drinks. I preferred sitting on the mainfloor to get the natural lighting. Cozy and comfortable.FOOD: Ordered the lamb, samosa starters. Three curries with a mix of naan and rice -- this is a must. Highly recommend getting a variety of them to try. SERVICE: Fantastic and helpful service. Server was great and recommending dishes for us. VALUE/OVERALL: Great value and will definitely will visit again!",5 
236,"My first AND last meal in London! The hype is real and this restaurant is a must if you're visiting London. There are numerous locations throughout London but this spot was the most convenient for us. The long queue outside might seem daunting but it moves pretty quickly and there are people offering you hot tea as you wait in the freezing cold. As you get closer, there are heat lamps that temporarily help. Once you're ushered into the restaurant, you think you're about to be seated but you're just transferred to the downstairs bar area while you wait for a table to open up.My favorite dish at Dishoom has to be the chicken ruby. It's AMAZING. The curry is phenomenal and we had to order more garlic naan to wipe the rest of the curry clean! I just can't stop thinking about that delicious curry! The chicken was terrific and was soft and tender. Another favorite of mine was the lamb biryani. The lamb was properly cooked (super tender) and the spices in the bowl were spot on. I could go on and on about how great Dishoom is but you might be reading for a while. Here's what you need to know...if you're in London, you have to eat Indian food and that means making a trip to Dishoom.",5 
237,"Was literally bussin in my pants eating the chefs special, this place is insane and incredible also free water",5 
238,"Not even close to worth the wait. The portions are small and come out way too quickly so by the time you get around to the curry, it's cold. The naan portions are way too small for the price and the service is spotty because they don't feel like they need to try and uphold their reputation.",2 
239,"This place is ok, not great. The food was unspectacular and a bit of a let down for such a hyped place. The interior is impressive though.",3 
240,"I absolutely love this restaurant, every time I make it to London and call on a whim the staff will do their best to accommodate my reservation.They are also wonderful in pointing out the best vegetarian options as well as cocktails I may enjoy ( their espresso martini with a spicy kick is TO DIE FOR) I genuinely can't wait to be back again next year.",5 
241,The food at dishoom is just as worth it as everyone says. Truly a unique dining experience and wonderful ambience. Only issue was the wait.,5 
242,"Top 10 Indian Food outside of India itself. I've never been so stunned. Ordered a lot of stuff and left a happy man. The chicken tikka masala was lovely, the naan was lovely, the desserts were lovely, it was all a 10/10 experience.",5 
243,"I went here for breakfast and the food was amazing! If you're looking for a twist for your breakfast, I recommend trying Dishoom. I went there around 10:30 on a weekday so I was able to get in without a wait. I noticed that there was a long line around 11am so I recommend getting here early! The naan roll is definitely a must! It was a little hard to eat because everything started falling out of the naan but the taste was amazing. Im going to go back again for their dinner menu but I definitely recommend this spot for breakfast!",5 
244,I don't eat lamb chops but these were the kind you wanted to suck off the bone. The Red chicken curry took me back to my childhood. Paired it with the garlic naan bread and basmati rice.,5 
245,Warning !!! If you haven't got a reservation the line is massive and relentless but don't give up as it's worth it. If you are in the mood for a traditional curry you are in the wrong place.  Dishoom plays with flavors and makes an Indian meets tapas experience one to remember.,4 
246,"I got the chole puri which was absolutely amazing. The flavors were so strong. The puri wasn't what I originally expected, it was more of a thin soft bread. But it complimented the chickpea curry very well. I think there was some green chili in the curry, making it a little spicy. It was a big portion and perfect for lunch. I highly recommend the chole puri. My friends have been here quite a number of times and have loved everything they've had on their menu. It's a great place to share and their small plates are good!",5

248,"Dishoom is my all time favorite. The closest you can get to MUMBAI :DWe went to Dishoom in December on a rainy day for a late lunch. There was still a queue of 50 mins.They were courteous & provided hot chai while we waited. We waited out for about 25 mins and at the bar for about 20.The food was no doubt the best.We ordered VADA PAV, pav bhaji, paneer roomali wrap, cheese chili toast, black daal & roomali roti.For drinks- kala Khata, chillitini and the colaba colata  Everything was excellent, the taste was delightful & service was splendid. Overall a wholesome experience!",5 
249,"If Yelp let me give 6 stars, I would. Dishoom is absolutely incredible! Pro tip: get lunch here! We arrived at 11:30, without reservations for a party of 4 and 2 high chairs, and waited about 40 minutes for a table inside, which I thought was extremely reasonable (the line snaked around the building by the time we finished an hour and change later). The hostess and waiter were both extremely kind and accommodating for our 2 little ones, which was above and beyond. The atmosphere on the inside is trendy Bombay meets diner and was adorable. Downstairs was even cozier and more intimate. We started with the hot chai, which is the best I have ever had, (you could even get it spiked)! The waiter was excellent and walked us through the menu and gave glowing recommendations. He let us know that everyone orders about 2-3 items, which was a ton of food, even with big appetites. We settled on the chili chicken (absolutely banging), chicken tikka (INCREDIBLE), a lamb biryani and chicken briyani (both spicy yet delightful), chicken ruby  (basically a butter chicken with sauce so amazing I want to bathe in it), and the gunpowder potatoes. We added some raita, a yogurt sauce, to cool everything off. The seasoning on everything was impeccable, and while I loved it all, the chicken ruby and chicken tikka exceeded all expectations and were absolutely flawless. The price point was exceptional, considering everything is meant to be shared. The overall experience was everything I wanted and more! A must if traveling in London!",5 
250,"Delicious take on Indian Food, that came highly recommended by a number of friends and online reviews. If you are going to be in London do yourself a favor and just make a reservation! You'll end up wanting to dine here and regret it because the wait anytime of day is LONG.I had both dinner here and breakfast here and overall really loved the food. However, during my breakfasts I had an extremely negative experience with the service that took away a star. I had dinner for 1, in between the Harry Potter shows. Even with a reservation I had to wait about 10 mins to be seated, they are just packed. It was really nice seeing them serve chai tea to those waiting, unfortunately I just missed it as I was about to be seated. I ordered some with my dinner and it was fabulously spiced, but not to sweet and comes with refills.  I'm lactose intolerant, but this was WORTH IT to break out a pill. Ordered the Ruby Chicken, Black Dal, Rice, and Veggies. Everything was delicious, but wish they had another veggie option. It was just roasted broccoli and snow peas bland and limp. They are known for the black dal and it was rich and flavorful. The Ruby Chicken was creamy and tomatoey! I found this to be way too much food for one but was glad to get the variety. Server was great, but super busy. I appreciated he got me in and out as quick as he could and knew that bc of my reservation notes of my time constraints between shows already.Breakfast was delicious, I had to come and try their bacon naan roll fusion take on a breakfast sandwich. It was such an incredible, come in and order it! I made a reservation for 8am with notes I needed to be out as soon as possible within 45mins to catch a flight.However, the service was surprisingly rude. I got there before they opened at 8am. There we 3 groups waiting, and the servers made a big deal about the two other groups not having reservations. However no one was there, and it remained pretty empty throughout breakfast (Monday morning). The group seated before me was also Asian and they just automatically grouped me in with them despite standing quite separately and having all my luggage with me as a lone traveler. She seemed quite flustered when I mentioned I wasn't with them, with a very sassy ""Oh, well do you have a reservation then?""I was then seated right by the door, along the staffs' main throughway between kitchen counter bar to the rest of the restaurant. Because of all the luggage and completely empty restaurant I asked if I could be seated in a less busy location, so my luggage would be in the way. She dismissed this comment and said this was fine. It was too early for me to argue with this and thought she'd know best. However, I regret not insisting because the next 40 mins  that followed was almost every staff member hitting and stumbling past my luggage. Yet somehow I never saw my waitress to even be able to ask for a water refill or get the bill. Never asked if my food was OK, it was delivered by a kitchen staff member. I waited over 10 minutes, after finishing my meal and still no water before getting up to flag another server dow, which is just so awkward! In conclusion, loved the food, will be back. However, while breakfast was great, what a shocking miss in service at breakfast.",4 
251,"Dishoom is a beloved string of modern Indian restaurants in London. Though you'll find classic dishes like murgh malai and lamb samosas, Dishoom's rendition of Indian food is through the lens of Irani cafes in Bombay. The Covent Garden location is largely walk-in, and rain and shine you'll find shivering hordes waiting to get in and being treated to delicious cups of hot and milky chai. We timed it relatively well on a Sunday night and ended up waiting about 30 minutes to get in, and then another 15 at the bar.The cocktail list is long and to-theme, including a thoughtful list of mocktails. The majority are 8.50 pounds. Cyrus Irani, my choice, was a straightforward tequila sour; Debonair was a fine frozen drink. By far the best drink here is the Hoppy Paanch, an IPA, Johnny Walker, and butter syrup concoction that tastes far better than that description. I drank most of my boyfriend's (oops).Once seated in the cozy and buzzing downstairs, we ordered everything to share, with a little help from our waiter. Complimentary papadum with tri-colored dips was a satisfying, if standard, way to start off the meal; pau bhaji and okra fries (4.50 each) were both well-done and nice ways to continue our carb streak.Our larger plates were spiced and fragrant gunpowder potatoes (6.70); decent lamb chops (12.90) strewn with pomegranate seeds; a fine chicken ruby (10.50); and a delicious but small prawn dish (17.50). Although we were happily in a food orgy, mopping up sauces with naan, I couldn't help but wonder what I was missing.Everything was done well, but nothing was really above and beyond in the way that, say, Pondicheri in Houston is. Prices are elevated but not too bad; we had a bill around 75 pounds for our party of four (excluding drinks), and that was somewhat inflated by the prawns. Service is rushed but reasonable given the popularity. Bathrooms are very nice. Decor and atmosphere in general is great.I understand why Dishoom is a must-go in London, and it has plenty of convenient locations, but I was expecting something just a little extra.",4 
252,"You know a place is good when you get multiple recommendations from various friends before a trip. Four different friends recommended Dishoom. I definitely wanted to eat Indian food while in London, so I was determined to try Dishoom. It took me three tries to eat there, but when I finally did have dinner there, I was not disappointed. I saw the line down the sidewalk one day and decided to come back the next day. I'm glad I got there somewhat early (4:30p) because I still had to wait 40 minutes. They offered some sort of milk drink in the line, but I didn't have any. I did have some water, when I was able to wait at the bar for my table.My server was so helpful and provided suggestions. I was starving, but didn't want to order too much food so he helped me pick out some dishes. I started with the okra fries. They were so damn good. I could have just eaten the okra and beensatisfied lol. I love okra so much. The seasoning and the crispiness of the breading was just different and delicious. I ordered the East India Gimlet and it was also very good. It wasn't terribly sweet which is what I prefer.For my main course I had the Murgh Malai (incredibly tender and delicious), Chicken Ruby (the sauce was soooo good), and garlic naan. When the food came out, I was still chowing down on the okra fries. My server came over and kindly told me to eat my main dish before it got cold LOL. I devoured everything. I really wish we had Dishoom in the States. I would be eating there on a weekly basis. Amazing food, great service! Definitely worth the wait! Dishoom will be a must the next time I visit London.",5 
253,"It is well known that London has a sprawling Indian food scene that serves some of the best Indian cuisines outside of India. Dishoom, a small chain of seven ""Bombay Cafes"", is definitely on the top of the list for both locals and tourists alike.Online reservations can be made for breakfast and lunch only. They do not accept reservations for dinner and the only way to get in is the old traditional way - stand in line! There have been times when we walked past a Dishoom during dinner hours and saw lines wrapping around the block.The ""Bombay Café"" style features a casual but moderately upscale and comfortable environment with cool vibes. The atmosphere is friendly and vibrant, and is always a perfect place to chill, and to grab some yummy Indian food with a couple of bottles of Kingfisher.VEGETABLE SAMOSAS:  The skin was paper-thin and fried to a perfect crispiness that when I sank my teeth into it, the skin just crumbled and melted away while the filling made with veggies and mashed potatoes greeted my mouth with a warmly spicy yumminess.CHICKEN RUBY:  It looked like a variation of the famous tikka Marsala which was a tomato based curry with cubed chicken breast meat.  The ruby dish, however, came with makhani sauce which was silky and smooth. It really tasted like tikka Marsala but with a stronger flavor of ginger and garlic. It had a nice balance of sweetness versus spiciness and was delicious beyond words.GUNPOWDER POTATOES:  If you asked me to recommend a ""must-order"" item then this is it, not just because it was so amazingly good, but also because you can't find this anywhere else. Skin-on potatoes were fire grilled, cut into pieces, then sautéed with butter and an abundance of peppers and exotic spices. It was without a doubt one of the most memorable potato dishes that I've ever had.We also had a roti to mop up the sauce from the ruby chicken, some rice, and a bowl of vegetables. Everything was good beyond belief.5 stars+",5 
254,"I have to say this restaurant is overrated. Their food is good, but it's not that good.They do not take reservations. We waited for about 35 minutes or so outside and then 15 minutes or so at the bar downstairs. Once again, their food is good but I don't think it's worth waiting for close to an hour. We ordered the lamb chops (my favorite), murgh malai, and chicken ruby. I would give 4 stars for the food, but with the long wait, I cannot give more than 3 stars.Pro-Tip:Even if the queue looks relatively short outside, it's likely to be a long wait as there are people waiting for their tables at the bar downstairs.I would not return to Dishoom nor do I recommend this to anyone. There are many other good restaurants in London and there's also better way to spend time than waiting in line.******************************If you found something useful in my review, please hit ""useful"" so that I can improve my reviews.

255,"One of the best Indian restaurants in London. Multiple locations. Covent Garden is a little smaller but great location. Always long lines, but they serve you Chai Tea while you wait. Great service. Fun, upscale vibe. Cocktails, bar, and full drink menu. Mondo Brewing beer on tap. Tons of food options from finger plates to entrees. Reasonably priced and all delicious. Overall highly recommended if you are in London or Edinburgh!",5 
256,"Yum yum yum yum yum yum yum yum!!!   So delicious!  And our server Freya, was fabulous, awesome and adorable.",5 
257,"If you like Indian food but are wary of the consistently great reviews (and long lines at some of their locations) - come here! The food is worth it!Food/drinks: We were advised to get 6 plates to share for 2, and ended up with dahl, fried mutton, v",5 
258,"Very nice evening. I had to wait a bit (20"") to be seated but it was worth the wait. Was served some complimentary Hot Chai while I waited.Once seated the service was prompt and very courteous. The Kingfisher lager was, as expected, very tasty. Opted for a small plate (appetizer) of Kerman's Pau and an entre of a spicy lamb stew fry with a side of rice. These dishes also came t very quickly (surprising given the packed house of the evening)",4 
259,"Long wait? Usually. Busy bar? Yup. Worth the hassle?  Absolutely!I've been coming here for years, and by far this is my favorite Indian restaurant in London. Both London locations are terrific with amazing dishes, always worth the wait. I'm looking forward to the next time.",5 
260,This was one of the best restaurants in London! Hands down !!! Food and staff are both top notch!,5 
261,"About as good as it gets. Most recent visit, got the black daal and regular naan to start, followed by the chicken ruby with roomali roti. (It was a lot for a solo lunch...) The black daal is amazing, although there's so much else I want to try here it's hard to say whether I'd get it again next time. The chicken ruby, on the other hand, would be hard to ever skip -- I get that this is the most basic of Indian dishes, but it's so incredible, and the one here is probably my favorite. Of course, the naan (both the regular and, especially, the garlic) are amazing too. I really liked the roti as well, but it wasn't at the same level as the naan in my opinion, and actually made me appreciate how incredible the roti is at Roti King (where I went for the first time on this trip).Overall, really amazing food for surprisingly cheap prices, if you can get in...",5 
262,Absolutely delicious! Do yourselves a favor and wait! The line looks a little intimidating but it moves at a decent rate and the food does not disappoint!,5 
263,"Enjoyed every single dish I've tried here on my second visit (needed to try more after being wow-ed on my first visit. The one hour wait was worth it.-Service: Attentive.-Food: House black daal was beyond amazing, and I'm not usually a huge fan of daal. I thought I'd try it since it was highly recommended as a popular dish. Chicken Ruby was nicely creamy and flavorful (Heads up, it's a small serving for a main dish). Okra fries were good with a light batter (loved mixing the spicy chutney with the sweet tamarind chutney for the okra dip). Paneer Tikka was mildly spicy and a solid choice. This came with some grilled bell peppers and onions.Jackfruit Biryani was done very well - the spice flavors paired well with the curry dishes. Raita cooled down the spiciness of the hot chutney. Two thumbs up.Passionfruit Sharbat is very simple, but it's very satisfying. It's basically just fresh passionfruit,   soda and mint.Atmosphere: Always packed with a long line. Loud inside, but still feels cozy with the dim lighting.",5 
264,"Amazing ... I never wait for a restaurant for food .. but I waited for this one ...the food was delicious, the chai was authentic n perfect... definitely worth every penny",5 
265,"This place was good but certainly not the best Indian restaurant I have been to. We were served chai tea samples in a little cup while waiting in the 1-hour line. The sample was big enough to the point where I was able to gulp it down at least three times. :) The chai tea was slightly spicy, but it tasted good.The chicken ruby was a lot better than the mattar paneer and black daal. It had a creamy taste that was kind of sweet. The chicken was soft as well. The mattar paneer had blocky paneer pieces that were about 1.5 inches in length, width, and height. The black daal just had a bunch of beans in it.The cheese naan had jalapenos which wasn't what I expected. The jalapenos were not labeled as an ingredient on the menu and didn't seem too authentic.If I come back to London, I may check out this restaurant again.",4 
266,This is the best breakfast place in London. Get the naans you will not be disappointed,5 
267,"I'm soooo happy we listened to the reviews and came here. I've always loved Indian food, but I wanted my family to love it as much as I do. So I told them why not while we are in London? The food was to die for! The staff were delightfully pleasant. They served hot tea (I believe it was mint and chai) while waiting. Which was wonderful. It was a bit chilly when we went for lunch. If we are ever back in London, I promise we will be back!",5 
268,"This is hands down one of the best Indian meals I've ever had. I knew very little about this place other than that more than one person recommended it on Facebook. It was only later that I'd notice that Ruggy and other Yelp dignitaries had experienced the majesty of this modern Indian tapas hangout slinging traditional street flavors.Being jetlagged and coming here at 4:30 pm probably helped my cause of getting in without much fuss. The wait was about 5 minutes and only the arrival of my East India Gimlet and lamb samosas were able to drown out the guilt I felt over snagging a three-person table by myself.Before I was seated, I waited at the bar downstairs and had time to admire the cavernous layout and dimly lit rooms, surprisingly sexy and mysterious compared to the Indian restaurants I've experienced in New York.I ordered up the items I understood to be standouts here, and they didn't disappoint. In addition to the aforementioned lamb samosas, the house black daal and chicken ruby curry were both out-of-this-planet good. I mean, plate-licking good stuff. Make sure you don't miss either dish.Looking forward to a return visit on my next trip to London. Come at off-peak hours and order up a bunch of stuff. This is a place for sharing, yours truly notwithstanding.",5 
269,"I knew I wasn't going to come to London without dining at Dishoom, I foolishly tried walking over at around 630P to dine before a 730P production in the area. Laughable!!! My advice, DO NOT DO THAT! This place is crazy busy and the wait time was well over an hour on a Friday evening after 6P. I stood there for awhile contemplating weather or not I thought I'd make it in and have enough time to enjoy dinner before realizing it just was not going to happen. I asked the host what time they close and if they are this busy after theatre. He mentioned there would be a wait later in the evening before they close but it wouldn't be this long at all. I decided then I'd hop out of the line and go to theatre hungry. I came back at around 1015P and waited for around 20 minutes and enjoyed the best dinner. All of my usual, very basic (I know) menu items: somosas, Ruby Chicken, Rice, Cheese Naan, a beer and their delish warm chai tea they pass out to the folks waiting outside in the cold for a table.Service was friendly, food arrived quickly and I was in and out in less than an hour.I'd definitely recommend dining here but planning it out accordingly since no one really enjoys waiting long periods of time to eat.",5 
270,"This place is THE PLACE.I wanna start by saying that I am dying to hop back across the pond and get in for dinner solely based on how BOMB my brunch experience was here at Dishoom Covent Garden.I've heard non-stop chat about how great this place is, so I was very happy to get in and try it out myself. I'm just gonna go ahead and let y'all know what I had and why it was the best:If you like meat(and boy do I ever), then you HAFTA order the Wrestler's Naan Roll: smoked streaky bacon, peppery pork sausages, and runny-yolked egg...Perfectly cooked bacon and sausage, with a brilliantly cooked egg with JUST the right amount of runny-yolk! This was one of the best breakfasts I had while in London.ON TOP OF their tasty food (and incredibly reasonable prices), is the House Chai...which is bottomless! Get the Chai. It comes out PIPING hot, so be careful with that first sip, and has the most comforting and satisfying spice taste!",4 
271,"I must return. With all the hype, I was surprised even MORE people aren't talking about this place.I love Indian food to begin with, but this goes far past the food. The queue was obviously long. But worth the wait. Mostly for such hospitable waiters who came by with different drinks like warm chai tea or sherry wine or lemonade. All so delicious too. Then it started raining and they brought out large umbrellas!The staff, for working at such a popular, busy restaurant, were friendly, upbeat, and playful! I loved that they weren't grudgingly leading the next millionth customer to a table.Can we talk about the atmosphere? The hanging lights? The beautiful decor? I was head over heels for everything. Even the toilet!The lamb chops were definitely delicious. My friend ordered garlic naan to share, and I was surprised the garlic was actually so present in comparison to other sad naans I've had. Definitely wouldn't mind using up another London trip to eat here again. Beware of an hour wait though! It'll be worth it.",5 
272,"Having Indian food in London is really a special experience.  No matter where you go you will experience flavors and styles that are very different from what you usually find in the states.  That being said, Dishoom was an exceptional experience from beginning to end.  It was an unusually windy and cold night when we went and there was a queue outside and a quoted 45 minute wait.  We dutifully got on line and were super impressed by how organized the door hosts were and how we were offered complementary hot drinks numerous times.  The inside of the restaurant is fantastic.  Love how it's decorated - feels very different and yet special compared to most Indian restaurants.  The menu can be a little overwhelming but we tried a bunch of items and loved everything.  The biryani was outstanding and all the sauces and sides were incredibly flavorful.   I would love to have something similar in the states, but I guess I will have to find another excuse to visit England and to go back!",5 
273,Came around 130pm and there was still a line. We waited about an hour before we were seated.- chicken ruby - YES. THE BEST - black daal - good but the chicken ruby was so flavorful that this daal became unmemorable - okra fries - Bf loves but I think I'll stick to my potatoes - spicy lamb chops - good! I really liked the pomegranate seeds too Service was fast. Would definitely come back,5 
274,"I visited Dishoom no fewer than three times within the course of my four-day stay in London. The first time, my dining partner and I ordered a variety of dishes and tried two different types of cocktails each. While I don't remember the cocktails anymore (I believe they were whiskey sours), I do remember that they were delicious - although not the most alcoholic. We shared the plain naan, chicken biryani , house black daal, and spicy lamb chops. I loved the spicy lamb chops and ate all of it since my partner was vegetarian :); the chicken biryani, although huge, was a bit too bland for my taste with dry chicken. The next time, another dining partner and I tried the jackfruit biryani, and cheese naan. GET THE CHEESE NAAN. It was the most delicious thing I've ever had. Also, I loved the different types of Kulfi on a stick - my dining partner from India said it should've been only a few cents on the streets of New Delhi, but I didn't mind spending a few bucks for the most delicious and creamy dessert of my life. Great service - make a reservation and you'll be all set!",4 
275,"It was Day 26 in the Land of the Colonizer-- as an American expat used to spice and (gasp!) salt, morale was low as I concluded my first month of study abroad at Oxford. My poor desperate tastebuds, longingly wishing for the flavor of.... flavor. A day trip to London was suggested, restaurants were hurriedly searched, and off to Dishoom we went!  I have never been more emotional when confronted by food. The spicy lamb chops, perfectly charred, paired with a bright vinegary slaw; the transcendental chicken ruby, spicy and rich, creamy and slightly acidic; the chocolate chai intensifying in the richness as the glass diminishes. . . When my friends came to visit, we went twice in three days-- when my family came to visit, we went twice in three days.Please go. For me. For your tastebuds. For Flavor.",5 
276,"I have been traveling several weeks and wanted something different than the typical bacon and eggs variants. Dishonest proved to be a brilliant call. I had keema per eedu, which is best described as two fried eggs easy over a chicken chili like dish. It had a ton of flavors, a tiny bi of kick but I would not call it spicy. Many layers of flavor, a ton of meat, very filling and very unique. I also liked the chai there, a cross between plain tea and a latte, and surprisingly came with free refill. Looking forward to going again.",5 
277,"Came to this place with a couple friends for dinner. They had us sampling chai tea and lemonade while we were waiting in line. The line moved pretty quick and before we know it we were seated. We waited about 45mins which wasn't bad. We ordered 4 entrees for the 4 of us. We also ordered 2 sides which were bowl of greens and basmati rice. All dishes were amazing and it was an awesome experience. Most of their dishes are dry and not saucey like other Indian places I've been to in the past. We were all stuffed and super satisfied with the service and food. Definitely a great place for romantic dinners with the dark atmosphere inside. Even though we were full, we still wanted to order more. It was impossible to stop talking about it after we left the restaurant. Garlic Naan: Oh my god! The garlic naan was perfect with the chicken ruby we ordered. The naan itself was just as amazing. It had just enough garlic and butter on there to make it super flaky and good. Mahi Tikka: Hands down best dish of the night! There were 4 big pieces of fish which was perfect for each of us to try one. The fish was super fresh and amazingly good. It pretty much melted in my mouth after taking one bite of it. I've never seen fish at an Indian restaurant before, but man this was literally hands down best dish ever! I almost wanted to order another one. Chicken Ruby: This was really really good. It was the red tomato sauce with chicken in it. There were big chunks of chicken in there which were super tender. I ordered some rice and ate it with the sauce. The sauce wasn't super overpowering the chicken or over spiced at all. I'm super picky with my sauce, but this was really good to the point that I would be able to drink it just by itself. Dishoom Chicken Tikka: This was probably one of their signature dishes. The chicken thighs were super juicy and smooth. They definitely didn't over cook the chicken.I will definitely come back when I visit London again.",5 
278,"When in London, one must Dishoom! This restaurant really embodies the true British-Indian cuisine of London, showing how traditional flavors can be highlighted by subtle western undertones. If you are a vegetarian, then this restaurant is an excellent choice. If you are an omnivore, please given the vegetarian dishes here a chance because they are much tastier than the meat options.The house black dal is delicious. Yes who knew that dal, which is one of the average Patel's staples in Indian. could be such poetry to one's palate?! I am still dreaming of this dal for weeks after my trip. Dal is simply made of lentils, but the way it was slowly cooked in the cream highlights the richness of natural legume flavor. Dip it in roti, nan, eat it with a spoon - however you like and it can't be wrong!Again, the veggie dishes here are the stars! The pau bhaji, which is essentially mashed veggies served with butter buns is a wonderful fusion delight. The buttery buns are warm out of the over and go deliciously with this spicy veggie concoction. It tastes almost like samosa filling of potatoes, chickpeas, peas, and carrots? Not sure what exactly is in here but it is awesomeness.Next on the list is the chole puri, which is equally vegetarian and delicious. It comes with 2 puffed puri (a fried airy dough usually eaten by Indians during celebrations), with yummy side dips like chickpea curry and sweet hawla. I like how the 2 different sides complement each other with bites of sweet and savory.I love prawns and the masala prawns were no different. They were so juicy and tender, slathered in deep smoky spices of coriander and chilies. Soooo good, I had to eat the last one even though I was about to explode. The chicken ruby is Dishoom's take on chicken makhani and it held up the standard of a rich tomato-based curry. I love chicken makhani and it's rarely bad - as long as there is tender succulent chicken bathed in a creamy spicy curry, then I am happy. This made me happy.I hope Dishoom continues to grow and deliver its high quality London-style Indian food. Please consider expanding to NYC in the future!",5 
279,"Pretty good food. Pretty bad service. While visiting London I wanted to come here because of the great reviews. Unfortunately we came later on in the evening and our waiter was apparently ready to go. He rushed us to order, didn't refill our beverages, and didn't even check on us until he brought the check. We had to tell one of the other waiters to find our waiter for us. Since we were rushed to order and didn't get to thoroughly look through the menu we just ordered a few different tapas. Then he kept telling us to order more because what we had wouldn't be enough...it was wayyyyyy too much food! Some good, some just ok. My favorite was the okra fries. I devoured them! The prawns were pretty good just very spicy. I also liked the chicken wrap, basmati rice, and chicken ruby. The samosas were just ok. I didn't care at all for the potatoes. And I don't even recall the bread. This was my first time trying Indian food and I liked the flavors for the most part.",3 
280,"Stand in the line! It moves fast and it was worth every bite. I would literally fly to London just to eat here. What made it great was the staff, they provided my friend and I with hot chai while we wait and were super nice. Once inside they tried to help you choose your food choices to share with the table. We had the Ruby Chicken (must have), jackfruit biyani, lamb chops, garlic naan, corn, bowl of greens, and dessert. I ate so much and was happy to do it.",5 
281,"This is probably one of the best Indian restaurants I've ever been to in my life. I had to wait a bit for my table, so I went to the bar downstairs. The bartender was so patient when I was deciding on my drink. When I was seated and ready to order, my server talked me through my order. She knew what i wanted and figured I ordered wrong. She helped me and she was completely right. I devoured my meal in minutes because it was that good. I ordered naan, rice, and chicken. Next time I'm in London, I will definitely be coming back here",5 
282,"My third time there but first brunch with them!I love this place atmosphere: it's classy but chilled, the staff is nice and quick to serve you and the food...I ordered the carrot, apple and ginger juice with the homemade chai (which is bottomless...) and the akuri plate ( made of spicy scramble eggs, homemade buns and a plum tomato)Eveyrthing was delicious and very tasty! I totally recommend this place to enjoy fusion indian food for an original and tasty brunch",5 
283,"Quick summary: Delicious Indian cuisine in a lively upscale locationI made reservations to eat here long before I came to town because I was way too excited about trying the food that local and non-local Yelpers rave about. The ability to make reservations online way in advance is an automatic plus-one rating from me. First thing I noticed was that there was a huge line forming outside in the rain. Once I mentioned the reservation, we were led to our table on the ground floor immediately. The kitchen is on this level, so you can see the craziness from your seat. There is a downstairs portion of this restaurant, which I was grateful to not be seated in because there are no windows and I get claustrophobic. However, when I went down there to use the restroom I notice it was very interestingly decorated, with little alcoves for your party and different artwork. It probably is also less hectic and provides more intimate seating. Here are the dishes I tried with photos attached: Keema Pau- spiced lamb appetizer to get you goingMasala Prawns- Large, grilled, and seasonedRoomali Roti- A paper thin bread Chicken Ruby- Luxurious chicken curryGarlic Naan- Personal favorite for any Indian mealThe food here is well spiced, fresh, and cooked to perfection. It definitely lived up to the hype and has earned return visits and recommendations from me. The service was impeccable as well. This is a perfect restaurant for date night, special occasions, and to treat yourself. Their large drink menu also makes this an option for you to make a night of it with coworkers or friends.",5 
284,"Indian food in London is a must and Dishoom did not disappoint. Started off with a Watermelon Sharbat followed by a Dishoom IPA while Boyfriend opted for the house chai with unlimited refills. All drinks were so good that I often found myself chugging them. For food we split the following and it was all delicious: Garlic Naan, Vegetable Samosas, Dishoom Chicken Tikka, Mattar Paneer and a side of Basmati Rice. The vegetarian curry was my personal favorite. The reviews do not lie, Dishoom is where it is at. Tip: make reservations in advance or you will have to wait it out.",5 
285,"London is known for its Indian food, but it should be known for this place specifically!The long wait, around 40 mins, was well worth it. We ordered drinks to pass the time, which were delicious.My boyfriend ordered for us, as he grew up with this cuisine. The naan was perfect, the sauces perfectly spicy or sweet, the greens seasoning were delicious, and the lamb/chicken plates were perfect. We kept ordering more and it seemed like we couldn't go wrong! Spiked chai was a nice end to the meal, and the service was great.",5 
286,"On a recent trip to London, I decided I needed to have breakfast at Dishoom. I didn't make a reservation, so I showed up 15 minutes before the restaurant opened. I was seated promptly after they opened. There is a brunch deal but it is offered to two or more people, and I was a solo diner. I couldn't decide what to get, so I ordered two entrees: the Vegan Bombay (featuring eggless akari, masala beans, and an assortment of vegan ""meats"" such as sausage and blood pudding), and an egg naan roll. It was a lot of food, but I am a trooper and I plowed through it. It was all incredible. The naan roll changed my life. And the chai was deliciously spicy. I loved it all so much.",5 
287,Great authentic Indian food. Very popular but usually a lot of queuing and I don't think you can book.,5 
288,Dishoom is always a must when I visit London.I highly recommend going at an odd hour or you'll be waiting awhile. Their menu is pretty huge so here is my must orderMUST ORDERChicken RubyGarlic NaanBasmati RiceYou need to combine and eat all those together! This is an orgasm in your mouth!Of course throw in some Samosas to get you started while you wait.,5 
289,"Indian food isnt usually the 1st thing I search for when looking for a place to eat. However, stumbled upon this restaurant and noticed that they had over 1000 reviews and almost 5 stars. So, i figured i can not NOT try it, and i am SO glad that i did!Ws ordered a few things: cheesy toast (it was like eating a spicy indian cheesy bread - delish), butter bhutta (spicy corn with lime & salt - dont order this if you cant handle the tastes so good tho), chicken ruby (similar to butter chicken - yum), black daal (lentil), roti and rice. Everything we had were superb! If i lived in London, id visit this place frequently! Highly recommend!",5 
290,"A unique Indian dining experience, far different from the more traditional restaurants I have experienced in the past. Dishoom creates a fresh, modern take on classic Bombay cuisine in a visually stunning ambiance. Gilded light fixtures, beautiful antique photos, dark wood details, and intricately tiled floors provide a glamorous fine dining vibe. The interior is enormous, with two floors of seating. This would be a good place to come with a large group. Service was elusive and difficult to summon, but the place is super hectic so we did not really mind. To drink I tried the Rose Lassi, which was delicious. Nice subtle floral flavors, and the perfect amount of sweetness. We shared the Gunpowder Potatoes and Bowl of Greens, both of which were simple, flavorful plant based sides that would compliment any entree. My main was the Jackfruit Biryani, which was excellent. The jackfruit was not shredded as I expected, but served as larger chunks in a bowl of rice. Richly spiced and deeply savory, the tender meat substitute provided a perfect contrast to the aromatic basmati rice. The trio of condiment sauces served on the side further enhanced the complex flavors-do not skip on adding these to your food. My boyfriend does not like Indian food (at all), and enjoyed his wrap. Lunch for two came to just around £45-a bargain considering the quality of ingredients and generous portions. I would not hesitate to recommend Dishoom.",5 
291,"Worth all the hype!Chicken Ruby, double order of naan, and a coule of their Viceroy cocktails -- That's a night right there!",5 
292,"Loved every bite! We ordered grilled chicken, grilled shrimp, bread, bowl of green, fried okra and a couple other items, I don't remember how to spell the names but everything was very good. My favorite place in London so far (been here for 10 days). The staff is phenomenal, my kids have food allergies and they accommodated us very well. My celiac kids had plenty of gluten free options.  Some items were a little too spicy for my youngest but we added a bunch of yummy jasmine rice to her grilled chicken and she liked it. Again, the staff is so friendly and everyone is so accommodating we wanted to have lunch/dinner everyday here. For a family of 5 we spent about 80 pounds. The only sad thing is that they don't do take out after 5:00 pm, so we missed taking dinner home a few times.",5 
293,"3.5Apparently a trip to London is not complete without visiting Dishoom - if you're in the area I'd definitely check it out (there's a few locations around London).Came on a weekday afternoon for lunch and was seated right away. The decor is rustic with a mix of contemporary - not like your typical North American designed Indian restaurants which was unique. I really liked the vibe here - not too loud with bustling kitchen sounds and aromatic Indian food being prepared. There's cut-outs of articles on the wall and marble tables...it's quite aesthetic I have to say. I wasn't too overly impressed with the service, in fact I would say that's what takes away part of the stars for my rating. The waiter was questioning whether I knew Indian food (I definitely do, ahem)...in any case the food arrived swiftly. I got the matar paneer which was a curry made with soft cheese (tofu like texture) and the naan t accompany it (costs extra) and my friend got the biryani. The paneer was delicious and definitely had authentic flavours (can confirm authenticity after having paneer in India a few months back). However, this place was quite pricey for lunch...I'd go back occasionally if it was in my route. For the price I'd expect much better service and a more unique menu instead of standard Indian fare. In all not a bad experience and if you're in the area (Trafalgar Square) definitely venture in!",3 
294,"Food/Drink: we started off with the Okra fries which was basically vegetables but lightly fried with a thin crust. It came with three sauces (all of which are delicious and we later dipped our naan in). For entrees we ordered the chicken ruby which was divine!! Definitely worth the hype, it had a sweetish taste to it. We also got the house daal. I'm personally not a lentil person so this dish was mediocre for me but it can really fill you up. We got both the rotti and garlic naan with it. The rotti was quite thin and couldn't absorb all the curry so we had to get another order of garlic naan which was amazing, hot and fresh. Overall the food is delicious and worth the line! Price: while individual items are average priced, piling on altogether can add up to a large bill in the end. It is worth it if you enjoy Indian cuisine though. Atmosphere: the restaurant itself was decorated in a colonial style, the ambient was dark and intimate. Nonetheless the service was lovely a albeit a bit slow at prime dinner time (around 7 pm). Tips: Be aware of the lines! If you didn't make a reservation, the wait could be up to 2 hours! From our experience, the smaller the party the better for 2-seaters are easier to come by.",5 
295,"My favorite Indian restaurant in London and the location was great!!Made lunch reservations since dinner is on a first come first serve and lines can get extremely long. Be mindful people start lining up for dinner at 4:00.Atmosphere: Buzzing with people chatting, relaxed, fun vibeInterior: fun with lots of Bollywood Movie posters and picturesFood:Samosa: delicious, hot and packed with flavorsOkra fries: crispy, salty but our hands kept reaching for moreGarlic naan: mouth watering, buttery, garlic naan (order lots)Chicken ruby: chicken curry... was exceptional!!!Biryani: rice... which we poured into the chicken ruby because both dishes were that good! Overall, my friend and I really enjoyed lunch here. The food was delicious and the atmosphere makes it lively and fun. Our server was fun and passionate as well.Make sure to add Dishoom to your places to eat list for London because they will not disappoint!",5 
296,This location is currently closed until summer 2020. I wish I knew in advance before making the trip out there.  I did not try the food.,3 
297,"This restaurant was fantastic and everyone should find a way to eat here! If you are coming for lunch or dinner, my suggestion is to make a reservation. We came here for lunch on a Wednesday and arrived at 11:55 and just barely got a table for 2! The place was packed. We ordered:-Rose & Pistachio Lassi (must order) -Pav Bhaji (must order) -Lamb Biriyani (must order but try the chicken instead)-Ruby Chicken Curry-Palak Paneer -Naan The food was all 5 stars. I highly recommend ordering the biriyani. It tasted just like my mom's homemade biriyani which takes 2 days to make- with the exception of Dishoom's lamb being a little tough and the cashews not being roasted. When I took my first bite, I was sent back 15 years to my childhood. It was incredible. Next time I come here I want to order the chicken biriyani. Now that I am back in Boston, I am craving that rose and pistachio lassi. As soon as it was served to me, I slurped it down in under 1 minute. The rose wasn't over powering at all and the lassi was light but had amazing flavor. Next time we are in London, we will definitely be back here! What was really nice too was that the whole restaurant is decorated with family memorabilia-even the bathroom stalls!",5 
298,"Excellent Indian food found here. We started with a Rose lassi and Limbu sharbat (Indian lime juice). For starters, we ordered the vada pav and for mains we ordered the dishoom tikka masala and a paneer roll. For desert, we ordered the gulab jamun with fruit ice cream which was also very delicious. Everything was hot and fresh. Service was also 5*. Highly recommend this place and we will be going back!",5 
299,"Trust me when I say the 60 min+ wait is totally worth it! We wanted to enjoy our last meal in London, so I suggested we do Indian since 1. it is popular in London and 2. it is our favorite cuisine to eat. We arrived here on a Monday night at 8:00pm and were told an hour wait. We got in the line and were immediately brought complimentary chai tea while we waited. Once we made it to the front of the line we were invited to have drinks and snacks at the bar downstairs. This was after about 30 minutes of waiting outside. We sat at stools near the bar but decided to just wait until seated to order any alcohol. About 10 minutes after we moved downstairs, we were shown to our dining table. Our server was very knowledgeable and happily shared suggestions and recommendations. Everything is served family-style and the portions are smaller so it's recommended 4-5 dishes for 2 people. We started with the lamb samosas, which come 3 per order. The outside was crisp and the lamb was well-seasoned and plentiful inside. We ordered the mahi tikka, adwahi lamb, and the ruby chicken along with 2 orders of garlic naan.*Mahi tikka: this is sustainable Asian basa fillet in a subtle yoghurty marinade. This was a nice and light dish and tasted good with the extra lime. Even though this was good it was my least favorite and I let my husband eat most of it.*Adwahi lamb: The lamb is prepared with stock and spices, then layered with rice and cooked in traditional 'dum' style. This was deliciously spicy! Really generous portion too. The lamb was well seasoned and tender.*Ruby chicken: Tender chicken in a rich silky 'makhani' sauce. This was my favorite dish! Very rich and flavorful and creamy. Best mopped up with garlic naan! Lots of tender, well-flavored chicken mixed in.*garlic naan: Some of the best garlic naan I've ever had! We ordered one order with butter and one without. I'm sure you can guess which was preferred at our table! The naan was soft and well-cooked and evenly flavored with garlic.When visiting London, Indian food is always a solid option and look no further than Dishoom to provide a 5 star dining experience! From getting in line until walking out the door, we both felt well-taken care of and that we were valued customers.",5 
300,"Worth the wait!!! Incredible experience and food. Worth every second of the que. From getting a little taste of chai tea while waiting, to getting to our table and immediately greeted and helped with the menu, we loved every second of our time at Dishoom! The waiters are very knowledgeable of pairings and best ways to order for your party size. Ordered a Bellini which was delicious, had the prawn and the bhel appetizer, and the chicken tikka, veggies, rice, and garlic naan. All incredible! Favorites were probably the prawns and bhel!!! Great together, and the prawns had just enough spice with a cool herby dipping sauce. Can't wait to return!",5 
301,"Had to wait outside but wasn't too bad and they hand you chai or mint tea while you wait. Probably waited 30 mins for a table for 4 on a Wednesday evening. For apps we shared be okra which was my favorite dish of the meal, shrimp, and bau bahji. Mains we had a chicken tikka masala type curry (was called something else but was similar to this) and a South Indian shrimp curry. Neither of these were mind blowing but still good. Their red chutney sauce was another highlight.",4 
302,I don't normally eat Indian food so I was a bit skeptical when my coworker said he wanted to come here. BUT this place was so good! I am so happy I came here. The line was long when we first got there but it moved up pretty quickly.Food: Okra Fries - Dishoom CalamariLamb chopsDishoom Chicken TikkaMurgh Malai KulfiDrinks: Moscow Mule and Kingfisher beerEverything was soooo delicious so it was difficult to choose a favorite but I think I liked the Okra Fries and Murgh Malai most. I would definitely come here again the next time I'm in London. Service was excellent and the atmosphere was also very nice. Price was pretty reasonable as well. Definitely recommend this place.,5 
303,"Located in bustling Covent Garden, Dishoom is likely the most popular Indian restaurant in all of London. 1. What is the restaurant like? Dishoom offers a nice ambience that caters to a diverse patron base: families, friend groups, and significant others on a special date. Upstairs and downstairs seating is available. 2. What is the wait like?On a Wednesday evening at 7:30 pm, we were quoted a 1 hr wait. We expected that we would have a chance to explore the area after putting our names down, but Dishoom requires that all customers wait in line. To placate hungry customers in line, the restaurant offers warm chai tea and small bites. 3. What should you order?According to our waiter, the restaurant's famed dishes are the chicken ruby, prawns, house black daal, and calamari. We ordered several dishes suggested by our waiter including the calamari, chicken ruby, house black daal, spicy lamb chops, bowl of greens, cheese naan, and garlic naan. The calamari was a nice starter that we enjoyed with the various dips, especially the spicy house sauce. Among the other plates we ordered, our favorite was the chicken ruby, which was pleasantly less creamy than the chicken tikka masala that we are accustomed to but loaded with just as much flavor. It served as the perfect accompaniment to the naan. We liked the other plates that we ordered, though we would have preferred the spicy lamb chops to have been cooked a tad less longer. Overall, we were extremely happy with our meal and left with content bellies. Dishoom was a fantastic first meal upon our arrival in London, and we would undoubtedly return.",4 
304,Such a fun spot! The food was delicious. The cocktails also very tasty. We were treated like royalty as we waited for a table.,5 
305,"I love Dishoom! I've been here once before a while back and was so excited to have the opportunity to eat here again. It definitely holds up! We got to Dishoom around 6pm and waited approximately 30 minutes to get inside for dinner. The line moved quite quickly and it was very nice that they provided mint tea and lemonade while we waited.Once inside, our waitress ran us through the menu and we ended up ordering garlic naan (£3.5), basmati rice (£3.20), chicken ruby (£10.90), paneer pineapple tikka (£8.70), house black daal (£6.50), and the vegetable samosas (£4.20). We also ordered an Aflatoon's Colada (£5.50) and passionfruit Sharbat (£3.90).This was plenty of food for the two of us and we even had some leftover. Everything was delicious! The chicken ruby is very similar to butter chicken, the house black daal was creamy and delicious, the paneer was not what I expected as I usually order it in a sauce, but delicious nonetheless, and the samosas were nice and crispy. The garlic naan and basmati rice were also perfect companions to the more flavorful food! In addition, the drinks we got were both fruity, unique and refreshing! Unfortunately, by the time our dinner was finished, there was no chai left. I'm not quite sure why that was the case, as it was only 8, but truly a huge disappointment!! Other than that, super delicious food and worth the wait!",5 
306,"It was my first time here and it is also my friend's favorite place.  We were early to beat the lines, so we had breakfast.  The atmosphere was very lively and open, very welcoming.  They have a downstairs as well that's a little more intimate.  The interior design is well put also - modern vs authenticity.  We both had the bacon naan roll and it was delish!  I had also ordered the fire toast, but it wasn't anything special.  Just toast, but the home-made preserves: pineapple-pink-peppercorn jam, and tangy orange marmalade with star anise was yummy!My friend really loved the dinner menu and wanted me to try AND only another 30 mins till dinner menu, soooooooooooooooooooooooo we decided to stay!!!!  We took our time eating and chatting.  I had ordered the house chai and that was great decision, plus free refills!!  The lassi with fennel was something else, quite refreshing.  When it was time to order, again, I ordered the Ruby chicken with rice....make that two!!!  We had the same thing again and it did not disappoint.  I truly enjoyed it.  Boy were we stuffed!  But good and satisfying stuffed.  I would love to come back again, but I'm 5600 miles away now! Thanks for the great experience!",4 
307,"We tried the lamb samosas, chicken Ruby (a red curry), grilled prawns, a couple of cocktails, and garlic naan of course. It was good. The ambiance was good. Definitely a crowd favorite this one. At least I can say I've eaten Indian food while in London. But then again, I do believe I've eaten my fair share of really, really great Indian dishes in my neck of the woods (that is, Phoenix, Arizona). Go figure. This is a nice place to take your date to, but Iimagine you'd be good enough to look for better, less expensive Indian places soon after that first date (if you and your companion hit it off and both appreciate Indian food at its best).",4 
308,"One of the best dining experiences we had on our trip to London. Get there early though, it's popular and lines do form to get in.",5 
309,Delicious and innovative. Stopped in here and was exhilarated by the taste and experience of Dishoom. Definitely recommend!,5 
310,"We really enjoyed the place. Great food, ambiance, and service. For those of you visiting London, you may hear constant recommendations for Dishoom which I feel may make it more of a ""trendy"" place, but it does deliver on delicious food quality. Apparently, it's a relatively newer bunch of restaurant that has expanded rapidly (thus seems to have filled a previously unmet demand for such a restaurant).First, there is a wait. Usually 45 minutes to an hour so plan accordingly. The Dishoom at this location is located in a great area with many shops so one could make some use of the time. The interior is large and with dark wood tones. Servers are professional and friendly.Food is great. The dishes are on the smaller size (think tapas). We had the Okra fries, cheese naan, masala prawns, chicken ruby, and spicy lamb chops. All were excellent. Prices are very reasonable for the quality of the food. Overall, we were recommended to this restaurant by at least two people and I now pass on the recommendation. Check it out!",5 
311,"What a lunch feast to remember! Came here with a group of 10 for lunch a couple weeks ago and had the most amazing time. We had originally wanted to come for dinner, but couldn't get a a dinner reservation for any Dishoom in London! But lunch was excellent, and it's nice that they save a good chunk of their tables for walk-ins. Our server was very patient, kind, and attentive. She explained many dishes to us and gave us excellent recommendations. We ordered family style so I got to try a bit of everything. I had the:Rose & Cardamom Lassi: so good!!! Very refreshing and I loved the rose flavor. A perfect complement to all the spices. Cheese Naan: oh my gosh, so much cheesy goodness!!! The cheese was plentiful and beautifully melted and the naan had a nice moisture to it. Definitely wish we had ordered more of this.Chicken Ruby: yum!!!! This is so much less creamy and better than the chicken tikki masala I am used to getting in the States. The chicken was perfectly cooked and the sauce was so delicious. Awadhi Lamb: some of my friends loved this, but It wasn't one of my favorites. The lamb flavor was a little too strong (does that even make sense?) for me.Keema Pau: same feelings as with the Awadhi--I just couldn't get behind the lamb here.Dishoom Slaw: a little too much sauce, but it was nice to have something to cool down my mouth.Bowl of Greens: greens! Yay! Simple bowls of vegetables that went well with all the sauce and meat we had.Black House Daal: people loved this dish, and they're known for making it. I personally thought it was too sweet.Okra Fries: reminded me of some Southern-fried food. A little too oily (but I always feel this way about fried vegetables), but nice to nibble on.Dishoom Calamari: this was delicious! Nice, light, a little sweet, and with the tiniest of kicks to get your senses going.Pau Bhaji: solid vegetarian dish. Loved the simple flavoring. Not as much of a fan of the bread, but that's probably because the Cheese Naan blew me away.Fantastic service, great ambiance, and very affordable prices. Can't wait to come back!",4 
312,"If you're looking a Indian food with an awesome twist, go to dishoom.Pro:- the food (everything in the menu taste great!)- they serve you drinks (mint tea, chai, etc) as you wait in line- top notch service (they have a regular menu and a menu for people with dairy or nit allergies)Con:Beware there is a line. For two people we were estimated to wait for 1.5 hrs but we got in within an hour.So what to try: biryani, ruby curry, okra fries, garlic naan, daal! Everything tasted wonderful. Definitely worth the wait and the price is not too bad too.",5 
313,"If I could give this place 6 stars, I would. Came upon this place through a recommendation and was very pleased to have the opportunity to check it out. Went for a late dinner and arrived around 9:25pm. Even at that hour there was a line 30 minutes deep, but the wait didn't seem so bad as the friendly staff handed out complimentary fruit (grapes and dates) and drinks (chai and mint teas). Upon getting to the front of the line, you are given a buzzer and directed downstairs to the bar, where you can order drinks and snacks while you wait. Got the Bollybellini, a tasty fruity concoction, and waited no more than a few moments until the host seated us. They were more than accommodating when my companion and I wanted to switch to a different (read: bigger) table.Our server Ali was as friendly as could be and even gave us some great recommendations/suggestions. Between us two, we got the vegetable samosas to start (which we ended up getting an extra order of halfway through our meal -- yes, it was THAT good!) along with the Dishoom chicken tikka, spicy lamb chops, Butter-Bhatta, the Black House Daal, garlic naan, and steamed basmati rice. I could have just gotten the Daal with basmati rice and I would have been a happy camper, tbh. But really, everything was delicious and very flavorful! The garlic naan could have used a little more garlic flavor, but other than that, everything was superb! Aside from the great food and very attentive, helpful and friendly staff, the prices are reasonable. I would note that this place is more on the trendy side and the size of the dishes are similar to tapas style. Would definitely come back here the next time I'm in London! Already itching to try the Chicken Ruby and the Mahi Tikka. Again, Ali was an amazing server if you're lucky to get him, and really the whole staff was just top notch!!",5 
314,"So happy that we were able to have dinner at this lovely spot! Waited about an hour and a half.... and we read the reviews. We understand the hype and I still think this place is fantastic. If it makes it any easier, the servers offers hot chai tea to keep you warm in line. :) The meal was so lovely. We got a little bit of everything to try and although some dishes were spicy, it had a nice kick to it. My favorite dish is the chicken ruby, the very popular chicken dish, that tastes very much like Indian curry with big pieces of chicken. We also got the chicken and lamb dish, which were VERY flavorful and a tad bit salty, but when mixed in with rice, it is a great meal. We ordered the lentils (the black daahl) which isn't my favorite, but it does taste great when dipped with naan bread! We opted for a roti bread and a garlic naan which were both steaming when it came out and tasted heavenly dipped in sauce. I would definitely recommend this restaurant to try when in London! I wish they had a more updated system than having people wait in line.. but hey, it's a great marketing technique.",5 
315,"Simply fantastic!Dishes are small and you are intended to order many. Fragrant, fresh, delicious. We ordered off of the breakfast menu, it was so good we stayed for lunch as well. Chicken tikka=excellent! Service was top notch, friendly servers and helpful as well. The restaurant itself has a super cool vibe (especially in the lower level dining room). Absolutely will be coming back again!",5 
316,"A memorable dining experience and MUST DO when visiting London. They know how to do Indian food right. :)Made a reservation for 2 at 5:15 on a Friday night. Thanks goodness I did because the line wrapped around the block for daaays! Though my mom and I didn't have the emptiest stomachs for this early dinner, our waitress was kind as to help guide us through the menu (which is exhaustive). She did a perfect job of suggesting that we order 3-4 dishes, which were meant to be shared family style. Given our slightly full appetites, my mom and I ordered the dry-rub shrimp masala and chicken tikka (sp?) paired with a side of white rice and the classic naan. I was surprised to find out that my mom, who has a limited palette and low tolerance for spicy foods, actually enjoyed everything! She found all the flavors to be unique and interesting. The small family-style (sort of like tapas) portions were perfect for us and yet even, still a bit much as we had some leftovers. I also ordered the mango fennel lassi, which was delicious! Sometimes mango lassis can be a bit heavy on the yogurt and sugar, but I felt that the herb-essence from the fennel helped balance it all out. It also didn't hurt having this on the side as a chaser when the food got a bit spicy!For dessert, we had the chocolate fudge with cinnamon ice cream. My mom said she was in chocolate heaven! The chocolate was warm and gooey and paired well with the cool ice cream. Just decadent!Ambience was lovely with the trendy Indian, family home character vibes that this gives off! A lovely and lively place to grab dinner with anyone. Would definitely come back to try more on the menu next time I visit London.",5 
317,"Yes, I was one of those Americans tricked by the 1500+ reviews, so I stood in line outside for an hour. The food, by no means, was bad but most certainly not 4.5 stars worthy. We ordered the garlic naan, which barely consisted of any bread..it was mostly air inside. Also, it had little to no garlic flavor. My boyfriend got their special coconut curry and the sauce was soooo WATERY. Wouldn't call it a curry; but rather a soup. I ordered the chicken tikka, and it was too sweet/tomato-y tasting for my preference. I honestly expected a lot more from this place especially with the amount of people waiting outside. Clearly, you guys have not been exposed to divine Indian food!!!",2 
318,"I didn't think Indian food would one of my favorite meals in London, but it was! Dishoom is London's first Bombay cafe, and it lives up to the hype.My friends and I arrived around Dishoom on an afternoon around 2 PM, and luckily, we only had to wait about 30 minutes.We ordered the following:- Pau Bhaji (mashed vegetables with pau buns) - This was our appetizer to start, and it was delicious! It was flavorful with a slightly spicy kick, and it came with hot buttered buns to dip in the mashed veggies. - Spicy lamb chops - Deliciously spiced and well-cooked! The lamb was tender yet crispy on the edges, and it didn't taste gamey at all to me!- Dishoom Chicken Tikka - Chicken tikka is one of my favorite Indian dishes, so we had to try this. It was a little sweeter than I expected, but still good nonetheless. - House black daal - This was like a thick and hearty lentil soup. Creamy with great flavors. - Plain naan, garlic naan, cheese naan - Naan is a MUST at any Indian restaurant. They were all good, though the cheese was interesting since it's not a traditional naan flavor. I do wish the garlic naan tasted more garlicky and the cheese naan had more cheese though. - Roomali roti - The roti was recommended to us to pair with the chicken. I didn't think the roti was anything too special though. Texture-wise, it was like a super thin tortilla. I preferred pairing all the dishes with the naan.- Yogurt - Another recommendation from the waiter. This helped cut some of the intensity of the otherwise strong flavors of the other dish, so I thought it was a nice balance.- House sauces - The waiter brought out 3 house chutneys/dipping sauces (tamarind, mint, sweet chili?), which were delicious. The chili one paired REALLY well with the naan and other dishes - so much so that was had to ask for more!We also ordered the Bombay presidency punch to share (a bowl of jaggery, lime, Darjeeling tea and Ceylon Arrack), and it was amazing! It may be a bit dangerous, since it tastes so good and refreshing that you might just forget it's alcoholic. Our waiter actually forgot to put our order in until we asked halfway through our meal. By the time we got it, we were almost done eating, we so just sat there a while sipping some ""punch."" Overall, it was a fun, delicious, and flavorful meal with great ambiance and excellent service too! If you're in the area, I'd recommend having a meal here!",4 
319,"Yelp 100 Challenge 2017 83/100We decided we should have at least one Indian meal in London before going home so we found this restaurant on Yelp (thank you!!). We arrived around 7:45 and the wait was a full hour, outdoors. They serve you a nice warm chai tea while waiting, which was lovely. I really wasn't sure what to expect as we peered through the windows watching people eat. It looked rather crowded from the outside peeking in but it's actually huge and there's a whole bottom floor with more seating.I took one bite of the curry and completely understood why people wait an hour out in the cold and rain to eat at this place. It was hands down the best curry I've had anywhere in the world, including India and Thailand. I'm usually pretty good at guessing ingredients in dishes but I had no idea what they put in here to make it so amazing. The rest of the food was also very good, including the lentils, which I don't usually like. The lentils had a nice texture, not mushy like what I've had in the past. If we had more time in London, I would have come back here just to eat the curry again- it was that good.",5 
320,"Mmm, this place truly deserves all the hype that it gets! Hands down the best restaurant I went to in London.Two friends and I ordered the garlic naan, roti, chicken tikka masala, black house dal, chicken ruby, lamb and vegetable samosas, a bowl of greens, and a few sides of basmati rice. I also got the Bombay colada - one of the most unique and tasty drinks I've ever had. A little spicy and super refreshing with a good kick. All the food was absolutely delicious and the service was impeccable; our waitress was chatty and funny and recommended several of the above dishes to us.Moving on to the main dishes - so impressed! Out of all the entrees, I would recommend the dal the most - very meaty and flavorful. The chicken dishes were incredibly tangy and spicy (ask them to tone down the spice if you're not into that). The garlic naan was warm and buttery and absolutely delicious! As was the roti - it absorbed the flavor of the previous dishes well and came with three very tasty sauces. Great samosas (I liked the vegetable more than the lamb) and uniquely crunchy / salty / flavorful greens. Overall everything was very very good and prices were reasonable, especially for London. It's a fun place to eat with a lot of people since dishes are pretty small - grab some friends and try out a bunch of things! Oh, and make a reservation in advance - it gets super busy. Breakfast and lunch hours are less crowded so that may be a better option!",5 
321,"We dined here after many recommendations from friends far and wide.  Locals and tourists both see this one as a favorite.  The entrance can be a little daunting.  There is a hostess outside you check in with and then wait in an outdoor line.  Then you are brought downstairs to the bar area to have cocktails and wait.  The wait was long but well worth it.  We dined on everything our server recommended and more.  It was my first time trying Indian food and I loved it!  The service was quick as they are used to taking care of many people at once and the food was delicious.  It is tapas style so I would recommend 2 items per person, and to share family style.",5 
322,"Dishoom is a PHENOMENAL restaurant, especially for brunch. I was impressed by every single thing I ordered including the teas. My favorite was the Bacon Naan Roll, which I recommend to everyone whenever I hear London or food. The Bacon Naan Roll is so flavorful and all of the ingredients compliment each other so well. The first bite I took of the Bacon Naan Roll I immediately ordered two more.",5 
323,"I have to say, I am Indian and I love the name. The food is a unique twist on Indian. The names of the dishes are clever and the rustic feel sets for a time back in India. Chicken Tikka dish is very aromatic and hits all the right notes. The roomali roti is super thin and sets for a great meal too. The okra fries are tender and lightly battered. The food isn't Indian spicy like I would have wanted but the flavors are all there. Their rose lychee shake is great too!Great job!",5 
324,"Our party of four came around on a Saturday at around 6, expecting a wait. The line didn't look too long but in reality, it was a 1.5 hour wait. Their waiting system is actually pretty orderly. It's like getting into a nightclub. They have ropes (non-velvet) and have people line up. I'm not sure if this is just to make it look like it's poppin', because there were quite a few empty tables inside. Maybe they were for people who made reservations (only available for groups of 6+). While you're waiting, a waitress comes around and gives you small samples of hot chai tea latte. It was a bit too sweet for me, but it was a very nice gesture, especially since it was windy and chilly that day.Finally, once you get inside the exclusive Dishoom, you'll wait about 15 more minutes while they prepare your table. That's how they get you to order a drink at the bar downstairs. So I had the Chilitini (Luksusowa vodka with pomegranate, lemon juice and chilli liqueur) and for 7.50, it was pretty inexpensive for a cocktail (compared to NYC, anyway). I really liked the flavor and the bite that the chili liquer gave it, but I wish there was a bit more vodka in it. I guess I'm just used to stronger NYC cocktails, where they don't measure out the liquor.Onto the food. Here is what we ordered:Garlic Naan - our waiter recommended two orders for four people, but I'm glad that we didn't go with his suggestion. It was very oily, so it would have been difficult for one person to eat more than a certain amount of it. Could have used more garlic.Lamb Boti Kabab (pieces of tender lamb marinated with red chilli, garlic and ginger) - the flavor was good but the lamb was pretty dry. It definitely needed some sauce with it.House Black Daal (Indian spiced lentils) - this was like a soupy bean dip. Not my favorite but it went well with the garlic naanChicken Ruby (chicken in a rich silky 'makhani' sauce) - this was probably the star of the show, as it seems like the majority here would agree. The sauce is great (again, especially with the naan), and the chicken wasn't dry.Note - none of the 'entrees' come with any sides so you'll want to order naan or rice to go with it. The portions are on the smaller side so it's best to order a bunch of dishes and just share them. That way, you'll get to have a great variety.I don't know how packed their other locations get. I also don't know if I would wait another 1.5 hours to eat here again. But I do know that it was a great London Indian food experience.",4 
325,"Extremely overrated. Don't be a silly American and wait in the cold for one hour. Hop in an Uber and go a bit further out to Original Lahore Kebab House in Whitechapel for some great South Asian grub. I feel like those giving this place five stars have had limited Indian food experiences. Dishoom has a great menu in the sense they're small plates, so you can sample a variety of foods in one meal. The only issue is the food quality doesn't warrant the wait time. We waited one hour (yes, they give you complimentary chai tea while you're waiting, but only after you've waited about 40 minutes already) for this experience. I wanted to order dishes I did not have easy access to back home, including jackfruit biryani, spicy prawns, and cheese naan to name a few. Decent flavor and quick service, but not an exceptional experience. We capped our meal with a rose and chamomile lassi, which was refreshing. Prices are standard for London. If you had to pick between this or unseasoned fried food, I'd absolutely pick Dishoom. But, in a city with such a large Indian population, there is a plethora of other options.",3 
326,An inviting window into Parsi culture. Eating here was a pleasant experience. We arrived late on a weeknight and the restaurant was still packed when we got there. The Art Deco flourishes give the space the feel of another time and place. The kabobs were meaty and well spiced. We also ordered biryani. The rice was aromatic and complemented the meat dishes nicely. Would also recommend the roti.,4 
327,"Last year, Dishoom was named as the best restaurant in Britain according to Yelp. Unsurprisingly, the wait at this Bombay-inspired café averages an hour. While it is quite long, they do offer hot tea (chai and mint) as you queue up. Grab a glass - it'll come in handy as the chilly evening sets in. It's also both free and delicious, so there really isn't any reason not to.For being such a casual place with a reasonably priced menu, the ambiance here is quite upscale. To boot, the attentive waiters running around with smiles on their faces make for great service. They bang those dishes out blazing fast. I received my order within 10 minutes of placing it.On the flip side, I think that the food here is a tad overhyped. While they do serve very solid Indian fare, I was not quite blown away as I hoped. Per my server's recommendation, I ordered the Chicken Ruby, the House Black Daal, and the Garlic Naan. All very good, none particularly outstanding. What actually wowed me the most was the mint & coriander sauce that was served on the side as a dip. That stuff was to-die for, so make sure you at least give it a taste!**UPDATE**Since writing my review, I've been to Dishoom several times more, trying both their breakfast and all-day menus.

328,"Absolutely amazing food!! One of the best places we visited in London. Atmosphere, food, drinks, all of it was perfect!",5 
329,"I had been to Dishoom many years ago, didn't know they did breakfast but a quick internet search taught me that they are super popular for breakfast and with good reason!We made a reservation for 9.15 am online for a Saturday morning and it was fully seated. However, we took our good time to enjoy the super delicious bacon naan, egg naan and Keema Per Eedu - a fantastic chicken dish, beautifully spiced and I drank liters of the House Chai. By far the best Chai I ever had!The service was prompt and friendly, the atmosphere relaxed and classy without being pompous. Highly recommended if you wanted something a bit different for breakfast!",4 
330,"A superb restaurant, we look forward to going there again when things reopen in London. This place had rave reviews",5 
331,"Gotta be honest..I'm not a fan of Indian food. Never was. While planning a trip to London...I was INFORMED multiple times that the Indian food in London was THE BEST. That I ABSOLUTELY HAD TO TRY IT. Ok..I reluctantly agreed to give it a try. Dishoom, according to our radar, was one of THE top Indian food restaurants. So...Dishoom it was! When we arrived, there was a mini line but it moved fairly fast (10-15 mins tops). We were offered some chai tea while we waited...interesting taste indeed. We were quickly moved into the basement where the bar was...not much seating but packed and cozy. Onto our food. We decided to yolo it and order pretty much one from each section. Great decisions made that night ;)!!GARLIC NAAN 2.20 -soft and fluffy naan bread with garlic flavors floating out while you eat. GET IT!STEAMED BASMATI RICE 2.20-typical rice..I got it mixed up with the yellow rice...but this does pair well with the curry dishes.OKRA FRIES 3.70 -deep fried and a tad oily.PAU BHAJI 3.90-super soft warm buns meant to be dipped in this veggie paste?...it was mouthwateringly tasty.GUNPOWDER POTATOES 5.90-chunks of potatoes mixed with spices and a hint of lime juice. It was a lifesaver when we got hungry in the middle of the night and decided to eat the leftovers. CHICKEN RUBY 8.2-not your typical curry flavor. I can't remember the exact taste but it was very flavorful.All the food we ate was delicious and the price point was perfect. I would def go again. Must try in London!",4 
332,"Amazing food. Amazing spices. Amazing taste. This is the best traditional Indian food I've had in London. They're also everywhere! The line is usually out the door, but it's definitely worth going to because of the atmosphere, people, heartiness, and delicious food. There are many twists and accents the head chef spins on their meals, and I think the addition of personal touches is what makes this place so spectacular. My favorite dishes are the Chicken Ruby as well as the Morgh Malai.. and make sure to order the garlic or cheese naan with your meal! This is an amazing place to go to if you're ever in London, in fact, you MUST go. I will be upset if you didn't (not that my opinion matters, I'm just a yelp reviewer).",5 
333,"This was a place I had bookmarked for dinner one night but ended up not going until we wanted breakfast this morning and this place was recommended. My fiancé is not a fan of Indian food so that was another reason we didn't come here for dinner. We did walk by on a Friday night and there was a queue to get in and it seemed like quite a long one. Anyway, I ordered a chocolate chai since it was a little brisk this morning. It was perfectly warm and it had all the aromas that you would look for in a chai... if drinks could give you a warm fuzzy hug, this drink would be the one to do it. For our meals, we went with the naan wraps with egg. I got the sausage one and he got bacon (extra crispy). While it was good, it was not anything to write home to. His bacon was not crispy to start with - maybe some burnt edges. I gave him half of my sausage naan roll and I got half of his bacon naan roll. I want to come back here for dinner one day as I really enjoy Indian food. In the meantime, I will have to convince Brian's tastebuds that they like Indian food.",4 
334,"Wow this place is popular! Every time we walked by there was a line out the door! We came around 8/9pm on a weekday and it was about a hour wait. I liked that the wait seemed fair (followed the sequence in which people arrived) and they handed out hot tea while waiting. If you are waiting outside in line, they eventually move you to the bar where you may wait another 15-30 minutes. Luckily the food was worth the wait! We had their house dal and chicken ruby with rice and naan. This was one of my fiancés first Indian food experiences so I told him if he did not like the food here then he would probably not like Indian food anywhere. Thankfully we both loved it!For dessert we had the chocolate pudding with vanilla chili ice cream. They were definitely the perfect complement to each other as I don't think I'd enjoy the chili flavor of the ice cream without the richness of the pudding.I'd highly recommend coming here!",5 
335,"There was an hour wait, and I was pretty reluctant to wait. I'm normally not a fan of higher end restaurants, especially ones with a line. They asked that at least one member of your party is in line at all times, so it's easy to swap out and explore the area. The food was amazing!! It was flavorful, spicy, and savory. We got at least 7 different dishes, and I wasn't disappointed with any of them. I really liked the chutney sauce. The hostess was very attentive and kind. I think she had red hair with a non British accent. Her recommendations for foods, cocktails, and amount to order was all spot on. I would definitely come back. Edit: went back again, and it's still amazing. If you're overwhelmed with the menu, just get the ones that are boxed out on the menu. Can't go wrong with those.",5 
336,"My friend and I went to Dishoom on our first night in London. We got there around 8pm on a Saturday night and there was a line out the door. They don't take reservations so you're literally stuck waiting in line until they call you. I've heard London has pretty good Indian food and this place was highly reviewed, so we didn't mind waiting. It took about an hour or so before we got seated downstairs. After browsing the menu, we decided on the okra fries, the chicken ruby, and the paneer tikka. We got our food pretty quickly, and from what I remember, nothing stood out. The okra fries were the best part of the meal, but they still weren't memorable. The chicken ruby was alright, the chicken was a bit dry imo. The paneer tikka I could've done without. All the food was just meh. For a place that has such high reviews and praises I was quite disappointed. I don't think I'd come back here when I come back to London.",3 
337,Love it! Great interior and great food! I've been to a few branches and really like them all,5 
338,Amazing Indian food! I also love the decor it makes you feel like you're in a different time period of time. The entire experience feels authentic and I love that they have many vegetarian options as well!,5 
339,"chicken & jackfruit biryani are both really flavorful for what is mostly rice. paneer curry was good. broccoli salad was okay but idk how flavorful you could make raw broccoli. jackfruit was good but tasted like fruit, not a meat substitute. garlic naan was fine.",4 
340,"First off they have out chai and other teas as you wait outside. And their chai is actually amazing unlike other places who serve chai.They're cocktail menu looked tempting but we stuck with the food only. We ordered paneer (classic) and dhal makhani, also delicious. The garlic naan was on point as well. I can see why this is a very popular Indian restaurant in London. If I come back, I'm definitely getting more tea.",4 
341,"Really good Indian food with great cocktails. We came in after shopping at Covent Garden in the afternoon, we didn't have to experience any long waits as we were seated immediately. We had several of their mainstays including CHicken Ruby Curry, Black Daal, lamb biryani. Those dishes were really good. Especially the biryani, that dish packed a ton of flavor into that little bowl. I loved it. And of coourse we sopped everyhting up with some garlic naan. I'd suggest bring a group of people and order a bunch of stuff, the portiosn aren't the biggest, but they are flavorful and interesting.My favorite thing that I had at dishoom was actually their cocktail their Hoppy Butter Paanch. Oh wow, what a surprising cocktail, it has a IPA hop foam, and then underneath that it has a whisky and honey based cocktail with some spices, but when you drink it. it doesn't taste like any of those ingredients listed, it's an ultra smooth cocktail taht doesn't taste like beer or whisky, it does have some spices to it, but it's like a smooth punch kicked up with a hint of spices and it's so refreshing, I would prolly kill a gallon of this on a hot summer day, but seeing as it was 30 degrees outside I only had 2 of them. The other cocktails were good too but i just can't get over how good that hoppy butter paanch is.",4 
342,"Amazing! Not sure how any negative reviews because the food was delicious.Highly recommend the okra fries and the Ruby chicken (chicken tikka masala). We did have to wait but there's a reason for the wait - it's good food! And the wait seems longer than it was, wasn't bad at all, and they offered us warm drinks while waiting.",5 
343,"See my tip - for lines. Amazing food. Came for dinner and enjoyed an array of amazing food.  I wasn't a huge Indian food lover, but that's because we get a different version in the Western world.  I'd recommend asking your helpful server for suggestions - many sections have highlighted dishes and we ordered all of them to try.  The cocktails were fresh and yummy as well with a nice wine selection by the glass.  However , we did order the naan garlic bread, followed by the cheese naan ‼Save room for dessert - the chocolate custard was divine.  Part II- breakfast was a no wait / walk in at 10am!  We had the bacon naan and chai tea which was amazing!!",5 
344,"I want to be proposed to at this restaurant. Yes. That's how happy Dishoom makes me. Wow! Wow. Wowww. This was the best restaurant I've ever been to. The food was delicious!!!!!!!!!!!! There was a two hour line but it was worth every minute. If you find yourself craving Indian food in London, I highly suggest trying this place out. It's worth it! Trust me. It's worth it!!! I hated Indian food and I'm very picky about strong smells, but this restaurant was amazing. It smelled divine. Wow. Wow. WOW. I am officially obsessed with this restaurant. Wow. WOW. Wow.Get the Okra fries! Get the Garlic Naan and the regular naan. Get the Dishoom Chicken Tikka! You should also get the Black Daal & Ruby Chicken Curry. Honestly, just order the entire menu. If I was in London right now, I would.",5 
345,"I've never had Indian food before so this was a first. The line itself was a little long, about an hour and you can't leave the line. But let me tell you it was so worth it!!! The food was so delicious. I had no idea what I was ordering since I'm not familiar with this type of food. However the server made great recommendations. I can't wait to come back!",5 
346,Betcha didn't know they served breakfast!!  Food 4/5 Swap out your regular butter toast for a wide selection of fresh baked naan. Loved the onion jam it came with. Superb Sausage and egg naanEgg naanChili Cheese Toast TIP: FREE FLOW House made Chai Tea to warm you up on a rainy morning Service 4/5 Staff are hip and attentive!Vibe 4/5 Love the incense burning at the entrance!,4 
347,"This was our favorite meal in two weeks in Ireland/UK. The commitment to quality is unparalleled especially at this price point. The flavors are mouthwatering and impossible to replicate at home. The service is too notch. We would return often if we lived locally! Specific examples: Quality: a manager observed (with no promting from us) that one of our tikka masala pieces from the grill was burned and replaced it with a new full portion. We only had two pieces left and hadn't noticed.Communication: told us the wait of 20 mins (was way less) and instructed us directions to the bar downstairs, then greeted us by our name at the bottom. Then since they knew we planned to order lunch, let us know the timing of that before the kitchen transitioned from breakfast to lunch. Multiple people with staff also double checked that my husband indeed did not need sugar with his cappuccino when they noticed none at our table, and complimented his health choice haha.",5 
348,"This was an amazing dinner. When we first got to the restaurant we ordered wine and the potato crisps while waited. They told us the wait was an hour fifteen but we waited like 45 minutes. Then we had lamb samosa, lamb kabob, the lamb special, chicken ruby and garlic naan. The chicken ruby is BY FAR one of the most amazing things. Next time I come I'm not sharing and just getting the chicken ruby with some garlic naan and rice lol!! For dessert we had the chocolate pudding, which was really nice. I would have liked a little extra ice cream. Can't wait to come back!! Thanks Dishoom!!",5 
349,"WOW! Simply WOW. This is a intense, yet refined and polished Indian experience. The food was nothing short of world class. Service? AMAZING.  Drinks, although I didn't think Indians were well known for their alcohol, we really spectacular. This place was DEFINITELY one of the highlights of our trip to london. When we return to Europe, I will ensure that Dishoom is a possibility for one of our stops. Can I give more than 5 stars?",5 
350,"Food, drinks, & service were a 10/10. The best Indian food I've ever had! I especially loved the decor.",5 
351,If you like Indian food but are wary of the consistently great reviews (and long lines at some of their locations) - come here! The food is worth it!,4 
352,"We ate here and it was fantastic !!!!The wait can be long so plan ahead.  We got chicken ruby (our favorite ). , nan, murghalimali, raita was good too.  We also had the corn on the cob which was goodAll in all it was great !!!!!!!It is worth the wait and the prices are quite reasonable really for what you get.  The Dishoom IPA beer was good too.",5 
353,"Fantastic flavors and dishes. I got the macchi tikka, fried green chilies, gunpowder potatoes and would definitely recommend any of them. The house chai was great. Also be sure to get the cheese naan. Venue was nice and decorative, would highly recommend.",5 
354,"I was so happy to find this Indian restaurant. The food was delicious, prices are reasonable and they serve thumbs up! Yes be prepared to wait in line for about an hour or so but it is well worth it. They take reservations so I highly suggest that you make one before heading over and have various locations. The chicken Ruby was my favorite, the chutney so yummy and spicy and the decor just makes it an experience!!!",5 
355,This place is a MUST when visiting London. Food was great! Service was quick! Atmosphere is nice. Highly recommend!**,5 
356,"Get here early if you don't want to wait long for a table! We got here at 545pm and there was already a line. While you're in line, they give complimentary tea. We were given a wait time of 40 minutes. What's amazing is that once a spot opens at the bar, they let you wait there and you have the chance to order appetizers and drinks while you wait for your table. Luckily, our wait time was way shorter than they said and we got seated in 20 minutes!We had vada pav, calamari, and samosas as appetizers. For entrees we had two orders of the chicken curry, and order of daal, and the lamb biryani. Everything was absolutely delicious! My favorite dish was definitely the chicken curry. The curry itself reminds me of tikka masala because it's rich and creamy. The chicken was very tender. Great service, great food, and great atmosphere.",5 
357,"I heard from several friends who recommended this place, and now I know why! Dishoom was absolutely delicious, and even though I don't really eat Indian food, I love the food here! Food: 5/5! Actually all of the dishes were delicious, not a single one fell short. We had the okra fries and calamari, and both were fried perfectly, but very oily. Okra fries were almost like yam fries! The chicken tikka was good, but not spectacular. The lamb kebabs were better I think, but personally not a huge fan of lamb. The lamb biryani was one of my faves! The rice is amazingly blended with different flavours, and we added Raita to it too (felt almost like chicken over rice. We also ordered a bowl of greens which was actually very good and helped balance out the heavy meat dishes. I highly recommend the garlic naan and the matter paneer, those were the other highlights of the night. Drinks wise I really liked the mango lassi, and it was a perfect balance for all the spicy and oily dishes. If you're in London this is definitely a must try!",5 
358,"Yes, the stories about the line are true, but yes, it is worth it. They don't take reservations for parties smaller than 6 people after 6 PM. So either make a reservation and go early, or plan to go with a large group! Or, submit to standing outside in the cold with a cup of chai to keep you warm.Dishoom knows how popular it is and they have a seamless system to accommodate the large demand. The staff are all kind and understanding and help to get people inside to the bar as soon as possible. Once inside, the cocktails should not be ignored. The drink menu is extensive and, honestly, fun to read. Tried the bollybellini and their spin on a mojito. Both delicious and refreshing.When we were finally seated, we were given a helpful walk through of the menu with great advice on what to order. In the end for the 4 of us, we got 2 starters: Prawn Koliwada and Okra Fries, and 4 dishes: Murgh Malai (chicken), Gunpowder Potatoes, Awadhi Lamb Biryani, the House Black Daal, plus 2 sides: Plain Naan and the Dishoom Slaw. Sounds like a lot, but it was the perfect amount to taste and share. We were warned that the Biryani would be spicy. It was flavorful, but not painfully spicy at all.We had a great meal with warm ambiance. A bit noisy and crowded, but not a problem. While we were waiting to be seated, we were annoyed with all of the people hogging tables without yielding them to the long line outside. Yet, by the time we were seated, we also didn't want to leave.",5 
359,Really enjoyed the dinner I had here recently with my boyfriend. We were stopping in to fuel up in between bars and the food was great! We ordered a lot of food and it was all delivered quickly. And the drinks are also top-notch - I had the Viceroy's Old Fashioned and enjoyed it quite a bit.I was also really impressed with the efficiency with which they managed the queue outside and got everyone seated promptly. I don't remember all we ordered but know for sure we got the gunpowder potatoes and lamb samosas and both were excellent.,5 
360,NIce Food. I went with my friends & Family few weeks ago to celebrate my birthday. It was really nice experience. The food was very delicious. Looking forward to visit again.,4 
361,delicious food. you can't make dinner reservations and have to wait in line but it is so worth it. excellent service as well!,5 
362,"We came here for brunch on a Saturday afternoon.We were starving, but decided to wait here because of the amazing reviews.The staff came out with Chai for those waiting in line which is a very nice touch.We were given a wait time of about 40 mins but were let inside to wait at the downstairs bar in under 15 and then seated about 10 mins later.We ordered all the suggested:Pau bhaji - mildly spicy and full of flavor - SO GOOD, MUST GET!Chicken ruby this dish was very good, I wasn't blown away by it as much as the pau bhaji, but it was still worth the order.Black daal -  I was surprised by how much flavor this dish had since it's just ""stewed black beans"" but it's very good. I'm not a HUGE fan of daal in general, but they season it very well.The bollybellini cocktail was delicious, I could have had 3 more if i wasn't so full from the food we ordered!Calamansi smash I thought it was acceptable in comparison to the other, but my boyfriend really loved it.I forgot the name of our server, but he was only on his 4th day serving and was absolutely amazing! He was friendly and very on top of everything. Checked up on us regularly and was never too far.I think he was from Spain?Anyway, the reviews aren't overly hyped, this place is legit and you have to make time to stop here.",5 
363,So delicious! We waited about an hour but it's definitely worth it. Someone in line told us to order the chicken berry Britannia and Raita. Those two together were perfect.,5 
364,"The secret to queuing outside a restaurant is making sure that you like the people that you go with. I kind of resent queuing because I don't like following everyone, but I'm happy to be patient for decent food. Also, they manage it well and keep well stocked. Queuing isn't a great grand novelty in London, and they keep you watered.The breakfast naan, and garlic naan are great, berry Britannia, black daal, vada pav and a couple of recommendations, which were, of course excellent (especially the okra fries). Ooh and Chili cheese toast- I just love cheese okay.The staff are lovely, the food is also lovely, the atmosphere is nice and bustle-y- but not the best for hard of hearing",4 
365,"Came by Dishoom for lunch. They take reservations for lunch and breakfast, but not dinner. Definitely recommended to make a reservation - it's really easy on their website, and there is almost always a line when coming in. Easiest/most painless way to get a table here is to make a reservation for lunch, and breeze right in past the long line forming by the door.Service is polite but somewhat curt and rushed given the amount of people there are coming through. There is a very large downstairs seating area, and the booths have fun fans that cool you down from the spice.Their menu is huge with a variety of dishes from across India. Most of the dishes are sized and made to share, and the back has a large drinks and chai menu. The drinks are very small portions. Lassi is thick and yogurty, and the chai comes creamy and sweet. Favorite dishes:House Black Daal: Amazing, very spicy and creamy. Chole Poori - chickpea curry with a very interesting pairing of sweet halwa mash, comes with puffy poori bread. Delicious must have.Paneer: their paneer dishes are delicious, all well flavored with chewy paneer. The mattar paneer came in a sauce that was very tomato-y, and had very few peas.",5 
366,Overall fantastic India and great for a group meal. I've eaten here several times and have always enjoyed the experience.,5 
367,"One of the best meals ever, in my life!  The wait was long and it was raining(Dishoom provides umbrellas) but completely worth it!  Don't miss out, next time in London eat here!",5 
368,"1. Service- very attentive and friendly. Both times I came here, I had two different servers, and they were both very professional. They were very welcoming and they made sure you had everything you needed. It's A-La-Carte, so wait to be seated, order and pay at the table. 2. Price- this place is affordable, and not expensive at all. For two people, you'll pay about £30, but that depends on how much you order though. 3. Ambiance- modern and hip. There are two stories to this particular restaurant. I guess you can say there is a Ground level and a Lower Ground Level. Or perhaps as we better understand in the states, 1st floor and a basement. Haha. Dress code is casual. 4. Food- we had cheese naan, Gunpowder potatoes, Chicken Ruby, Dishoom Chicken Tikka, and Vegetable Biryani. My favorite were the potatoes, and the Tikka. Everything was very flavorful and I have to say, it's the best Indian restaurant I've ever been to.5. Cleanliness- superb. I can't complain.",5 
369,"Me and my wife were looking for a breakfast spot and we happened to stumble a upon this place.As we walked in it smelled of everything delicious. Lol. There was fresh naan being cooked and the the Indian spices was just oh so good.We both decided in the Big Engilsh style Indian breakfast. Which was a great idea  because we were both hungry and we need the energy for the day of tours. It cam with Indian style eggs, which is scrambled with some spices, very delicious.. 2 bangers and 2 slices of bacon, a small bowl of baked beans and 2 buns. Everything was so good and it was sooo filling. We also wanted to try the naan so we ordered a bacon and egg naan. We saw them making it in there big tandoori oven which was soo cool. The naan-wich was very good as well. The naan was very soft and light and yet soo crispy. With the filling and the naan it was just a great combo.",4 
370,"Dishoom was our first stop in London for dinner and well worth the wait. With 700+ reviews already here, I'll give you a rundown of what stood out to me most. 1) The line outside snaked around and around, but they sweetened the experience with hot chai tea and sherry. Once you get inside, you *may* think your wait is over but instead, you're transported downstairs to the bar area. We had enough time to get a drink and apps there. Our total wait time was about an hour but these little extras made it fly by. 2) We ordered okra fries and lamb samosas at the bar, then Dishoom's signature dish (and vegetarian) house black daal, curry-infused chicken ruby, and garlic naan at our table. There's nothing I would not recommend. 3) I love how Indian restaurants offer an array of non-alcoholic drinks that are delicious like laasis, and Dishoom takes that one step further with teas, coffees, and sodas. That being said, I still went with some cocktails including the super refreshing Bollybellini and classic Bombay Pimm's. 4) I truly enjoyed reading the menu and learned that the restaurant donates a free lunch to schools in India for every meal you eat at Dishoom. 5) I would've come back here time and time again (including for breakfast!) if I had more time in London. There are heaps of other dishes I need to try. So there ya have it. Believe the hype. Love the hype. Taste the hype.",5 
371,"One does not go to London without going to the legendary Dishoom. It's the only place on Yelp that has 1300+ reviews and 4.5 stars. I had high expectations and was nervous that this place would be severely overhyped, but Dishoom was an A+ in my book.I heard the wait times can be insanely long (one night we called and they said it was 2 hour queue for dinner). So we decided to go the next day for lunch and prayed to the food Gods. We got there at 12pm on the dot and our prayer was answered as we got seated immediately. The place was already packed on both levels. Decor is cute and what I love about this place is that for every meal purchased, they donate a meal to an organization charity :) More reasons to eat here!We ended up with the chicken tikka masala (called chicken ruby on the menu), the paneer masala, black house daal, garlic naan, and the keam. Everything was beyond fantastic. As everyone suggests, I highly recommend the chicken ruby and  daal (vegetarian and slow cooked for 24 hours). Consistency was nice, creamy, and not overly thick. Tender chunks of meat that just pair so well with the naan. Thankfully for me, the food was not terribly spicy which made my eating experience more enjoyable.Service was prompt, courteous, and on point. Water was always refilled without asking, and the flow of the place didn't make me feel rushed despite the growing lines outside.Overall, I would recommend coming here to cross it off the bucket list. Wasn't expecting such amazing Indian food in London and am pleasantly surprised, but no complaints here :DNote: the dishes do not come with rice. You need to order it separately and it costs around $3USD per bowl. Note 1: there also seems to be sister locations of Dishoom nearby? Haven't been there but would imagine it to be similar, so if this place is packed maybe stop by it's other location.",4 
372,"Amazing simply amazing.So first off - get here early. The line is pretty long and there's not a lot of cover for you if it rains.The service here is amazing and the food comes out to you very quickly. Our waitress was also super polite and was very helpful in choosing plates.We had a multitude of dishes and the review would be too long of I only listed it all but something's that stood out were the chicken ruby, vegetable samosas, and the chocolate pudding. The chicken ruby was creamy soft, and went well with the garlic naan. The samosas were also pretty good and went well with the dipping sauce. The chocolate pudding tasted like a dream and the chili ice cream brought out the sweetness of the pudding.",5 
373,"On holiday here in London and looked on Yelp to see where we should eat at, this place came up as #1, plus we drove/ walked by multiple times in the past couple days and there has been a line around the building and down the street. We came at 7Pm and had an hour and twenty minute wait..... let me just tell you it was worth every second! The staff that greets you outside is so sweet and they even brought our hot chai tea out to you while waiting. Once you get next up or close to being sat they take you to the full bar downstairs which is gorgeous and the staff was incredible. We only waited a few minutes by the bar before getting sat in a large booth. We  started off with Lamb Samosas- which i was a little hesitant on... but wanted to order seconds!!! I had the chicken Ruby which was wonderful, along with the garlic naan! Soooooo good. My bf has the chef special which i didn't even get a chance to try because he was already licking the plate clean! Incredible flavors, incredible staff, amazing dining experience, and even better atmosphere ! Loved every minute!",5 
374,"Is there a better place in London for breakfast?  I think any conversation on the subject has to include any of the Dishoom locations in a discussion of the final three (please send me your favorites!).  Was there when it opened on a Saturday and had a Wrestler's Naan Roll with the house chai that just kept on coming.  I had some writing work I was doing and despite the fact that the restaurant continued to fill up I was never rushed or hurried or made to feel like I could stay forever (I've experienced that same hospitality at the Kings Cross location).  If you're even thinking about coming here for breakfast, or any meal, cease your thinking and get to booking.",5 
375,"Came for breakfast after a quick flight in from Zurich -- excellent food, and an interesting middle ground between boring/traditional English breakfast food and Dishoom style.  I had the bacon naan sandwich (which was excellent) and fried eggs on chili cheese toast (also great), plus a breakfast lassi and espresso.  Probably the best breakfast I've had in Europe.  Unsurprisingly the restaurant is still packed even at 9am in a weekday.",5 
376,"After doing extensive research on the best Indian food in London, we went with Dishoom because of its high praises both on Yelp and on Google in general. We arrived shortly after 5.30pm, hoping to skip the dinner rush, but there was a line outside already. We only waited about 20 minutes, but when we left around 7pm there was a looooong line so my advice is to arrive early.We decided to try two appetizers - chilli chicken (crispy fried chicken) and pau bhaji (mashed vegetables in a curry-like sauce). Both were absolutely delicious.For mains, we got the chicken ruby (often called butter chicken), roti and garlic naan bread, murgh malai (marinated chicken thigh meat) and of course some jasmin rice on the side. Again, our food was delicious. We were pretty hungry and ended up ordering another plate of chicken ruby. If you're looking for delicious flavored Indian food, Dishoom definitely delivers.My only complaint would be the £££ for sides such as naan and roti. £ 3.50 is pretty pricey for the small portions of naan that you get. It is only a piece each essentially and I saw people at other tables order it over and over again because they ran out so fast.Overall, a great visit and I would go again. I'm very curious about their brunch/breakfast menu so next time we're in London we'll be back for that.",4 
377,"Had dinner here. Had breakfast here. Both times were excellent. Dinner:It was just two of us. We over ordered simply because we didn't know when we'd be able to eat here again since our stay in London was quite brief and we wanted to try things. We started with okra fries, which were such a great shareable starter. It wasn't terribly heavy as a fried dish. It was crunchy. And unlike how I'm use to okra's membrane, it was not at all mucilaginous. Thin strips, seasoned, fried. It disappeared fast. As I said, we went overboard. We ordered the House Black Daal, Dishoom Chicken Tikka, Chicken Berry Britannia*, Mattar Paneer, Mutton Pepper Fry (half-plate) and Plain Naan. Between the two of us, we finished it all. And oh boy, did I regret it. I was so full. Definitely over ate BECAUSE IT WAS SO GOOD! But if I were to personally choose a sufficient order for two, I would say that I would have simply stuck with maybe three dishes. For me, it would have to be Okra fries, Chicken Berry Britannia (which was my favorite), and either the black daal or Mattar Paneer. I'd probably throw in naan just because it seems...right. Again, honestly, you can't really go wrong. From what it seemed like based on our over ordered tasting, you can't really go wrong. If you're unfamiliar with the cuisine, I would try whatever you think is of interest and then confer with your server. Always nice to converse with the people who are around the food. A delightful thing to know is that with every meal purchased, a meal is provided for a child in India. The restaurant sells cookbooks detailing the recipes for every dish on the menu plus history and PICTURES!Breakfast:So apparently, Dishoom serves one of the best breakfasts in London. If you're looking for an alternative to a full English or a café sandwich, try a naan roll. I ordered the Wrestler's Naan Roll and a glass of freshly squeezed orange juice. Oh man! The naan holds sausage, bacon, and eggs together and when the menu says that the eggs are runny, it is runny. It was a right sized meal for me to get me going. It could be too much for others. It came with a side of, what I believe to be, chutney(?). It was like a sweet jam made of fruit I couldn't identify. Nevertheless, it was altogether delicious. I'd have it again. All in all, I'd eat here again. Ambience is great. You have somewhat of a view of the working kitchen - at least a clear view of one of the staff preparing naan. Go for it! Try to either go at odd eating times or make reservations. It's a popular spot. They'll try seat you as soon as possible but be prepared to wait at least 30 minutes during busier times. Delicious!!!!!!",5 
378,"When in London, you got to have some Indian! If you don't have a reservation, the waiting queue is out the door. I didn't have a reservation and was told the wait time was 1 hour and half in which my boyfriend and I waited as we had nothing better to do that day. While on line, they would serve you some hot chai milk tea to wait as we were there during the winter. The line actually moves pretty quick and in less than an hour, it was our turn. Once we enter the restaurant, there is another short wait down by the open bar but the wait there was also pretty short and we were then taken to our table. The curries were amazing! Although, I kind of wish I didn't order the mango dessert as it was just a Popsicle stick. I thought it would be something authentic that I can't get anywhere else, but it was still good nonetheless.",4 
379,"Food: 5 | Service: 5 | Ambiance: 4I don't think I can write much that other reviewers haven't said already. I just want to say the food was amazing. Ordering the fried okra is a must! I ordered the garlic naan and the chicken ruby as well. Since I dipped the naan in the chicken ruby I think I could've gotten the plain naan, but it was probably even more amazing with the garlic. Service was fantastic too. It was fast and accurate which is really all you can ask for. The server was charming as well. Highly recommend this place!",5 
380,"I had always thought I did not like Indian food until I dined here. Indian food was either too overwhelming, too spicy or too sweet for my taste especially after visiting Mumbai many years ago. Mumbai's food evidently was not as life changing for me as the food at this Indian restaurant located in the middle of Covent Garden. Dishoom is a great experience if you are looking for fabulously interesting and ethnic food experience in London. You can't get reservations. You just have to show up and wait in line for over an hour to get a table. But trust me, it's worth it. We have only tried a few dishes here. However, an absolute must would be Chicken Ruby even if you don't like chicken. It's all about the exquisite sauce! For dessert, definitely try the Pistachio Kulfi on a stick. It's like ice cream on a stick except better!Pick Dishoom for your dining experience even if you are in London for just a day.",5 
381,"Indian food? Heck yeah! Indian breakfast foods? Sign me the F@%k up!! To be honest, I did not really know what Indian breakfast food was before visiting Dishoom. The Indian restaurants in Florida mainly serve lunch and dinner only, so an Indian restaurant open for breakfast definitely piqued my interest. There's multiple Dishoom locations throughout the city. For breakfast, we made a reservation online at their Covent Garden location. When we arrived around 8:30AM, it was pretty empty! I don't think the reservation was even necessary at that point. But around 9:30 -10:00 AM, when we were leaving tables were filling up quickly. For appetizer, we ordered the bacon & egg naan roll. Hot & fresh baked naan with chili tomato and fresh herb sauce. I ordered the Kejriwal as my main meal, which is two fried eggs on chili cheese toast. The fiance ordered The Big Bombay, the sausage and baked beans English-style breakfast with an Indian twist. Every plate was bursting with bright colors and looked absolutely delectable. An explosion of flavors in each bite. Go early to avoid the lines. Best and most unique breakfast you'll have in a while! We loved it so much that we visited another location by the train station for late dinner.",4 
382,Just go.  You won't be disappointed!  The chai tea is to die for and all their dishes are amazing.  We got an assortment of dishes and each one was spot on!,5 
383,"Great food, atmosphere, and service!Best experience I've ever had waiting for a table at a busy restaurant. There seems to always be a long wait of at least an hour at any Dishoom, but the staff really make that feel painless. They kept the line outside moving pretty quickly, and even offered little sample cups of hot chai or sherry, and umbrellas! It was a cold and slightly rainy evening, so those offerings were not only surprising but really nice! The chai was really nice by the way- very spicy and flavorful. They kept the line moving and had people head inside for a bit more of a wait, but they give you a buzzer to hang onto and head down to the bar area and they give you the free WiFi code. We ordered Chicken Ruby, Pau Bhaji, House Black Daal, Roomali Roti, steamed basmati rice, and mango and fennel lassis. The mango lassi comes with fennel seeds sprinkled on top, but you can order with no fennel seeds. They brought us garlic naan instead of the roomali roti, but they quickly brought the correct bread when we told them about the mistake, and they didn't charge us for the naan. However, I actually wasn't a fan of the roti- it's more like a tortilla and isn't good for scooping up the food. And if you order the house black daal, I recommend having naan with it because it's a lentil dish that has the consistency of a thick soup, best to be eaten almost like a dip with the naan. The daal was very good. It cooks for 24 hours- so it's very deep in flavor and rich, but surprisingly mild at the same time. A nice dish. The chicken ruby was similar to a butter chicken we've had at Indian restaurants, also a great dish. And the pau bhaji was really nice- a tasty veggie and spice mash served with baked buns. The dipping sauces they serve with dinner are all really nice too. Great ambiance as well- low lighting, warm, and inviting with amazing aroma throughout the restaurant. Definitely a must try!",5 
384,"Things to do:1) Order the House Chai2) Order the Bacon Naan3) RepeatWe arrived around 11:15, 30 minutes before the end of breakfast and was seated within 5 minutes. The place was packed. Loud, casual ambiance with both table and booth seating. Looking around, you can see the naan being made fresh behind the counter.For drinks we ordered the house chai and mint tea. The chai was the best chai I've ever had. Rich, spicy, and soothing, the (sadly) small glass of chai was an excellent way to start the morning. The mint tea could be smelled from a mile away, that's how fresh and refreshing the mint was.We ordered the bacon naan, akuri, the big Bombay, and the kejriwal, which was eggs on chili cheese toast. The bacon naan was superb. The tamarind BBQ sauce complemented the bacon extremely well. The Kejriwal was just okay. The bread was kind of tough and the flavors didn't meld too well together. I'd rather have had a second naan. The other people in my group enjoyed the Akuri and The Big Bombay, especially commenting on the taste of mushrooms. If I could give half-stars, this place would get 4.5/5. Not perfect, but pretty darn close.",5 
385,Heavenly.  One of the best recommendations for indian food in London. Long wait outside but the staff was kind enough to bring warm drinks and the food and service did not disappoint! We went to one in London and another in Scotland. The London location was truly the best.,5 
386,"Let me begin with - IT IS WORTH THE WAIT. I don't even really like Indian food. I am extra boring and bland and can't handle too many spices and coming from Hawaii, I swear we just don't have any good Indian food. That being said, Dishoom was the best food I had in London. Period. Waiting in line, we were told it was about an 80 minute wait. I had heard so many great things that I said I didn't care and forced my foodie partner in crime to stay there, despite all of his complaining. That 80 minute wait really deterred some of the people in front of us and we ended up only waiting about 40 minutes. During this time, they also handed out drinks to keep us warm and I had some yummy chai. Once we got inside, I wanted to order everything. I didn't know where to start or what anything was. Sooooo I went with the infamous black daal and all the naan I could eat. And, it blew my mind. It's lucky I don't live in London (yet) or I'd be there every chance I could get. Service was superb and quick and I can't wait to go back.",5 
387,"Love the interior decoration! It was fun. I remembered there's a sign at the door saying something like ""sorry cash only"" or ""no credit card "". I didn't plan to step in until they told me it was a joke.Went here for brunch. Chai was great! Actually I don't quite remember what I got cuz it's been a while... but anyway I was traveling from the states and from where I'm from there's nothing like this. Definitely a new experience!",5 
388,"How do you come to London without going to Dishoom? We've never eaten out at an Indian restaurant and were excited that this would be our first time dining out experience. We love some good Indian and Dishoom lived up to our expectations. The line/queue was quite long. (We waited 50 minutes or so). Everything was delicious and full of flavor. This place knows what they are doing. Everything from the lamb samosas to the lamb kababs, the garlic naan, the bowl of greens, the gunpowder potatoes, the ruby chicken were amazing. Skip the chicken masala (you can get this anywhere) and go for the Ruby Chicken. I promise you won't regret it.",5 
389,"Best meal of curry I have ever had! Making online reservations is pretty easy. I made the reservation in advance based on my friend's recommendation and you should too! There's always a line at the door during meal time.Since it was our first time here, we asked our server what she recommends but we ended up ordering too much food. What we were told was 3 dishes per person and everything is meant to shared. We order 5 dishes for the two of us so we ended with a bunch of food left and it's sad that we couldn't take away.My favorite:Chicken Ruby !!! (Chicken curry with a tomato based sauce)Smashed vegetables with buns (forgot its name)Black Daal (lentil with a creamy curry based sauce)",5 
390,"Service-wise, the best we got compared to anywhere else in London. My friend found this spot and we decided to try it. We went around 5 or 6 PM and there was already a line forming. I was just so amazed at how organized this waiting process was. While you're waiting in line, they bring out samples of chai tea for you to enjoy! We waited around an hour outside. When we got to the front of the line outside, they take you inside downstairs with a buzzer to their bar to wait some more. When we got downstairs somebody greeted us right away ""Christine?"" and took us to our spot at the bar. There is free wifi while you wait too. Wow! Then a very friendly server came to ask if we wanted any drinks. We were seated at our table not too long after.-Pau Bhaji: Must get!!!! This was my favorite dish here. Ordered it not really knowing what it was but got it because everyone else raved about it, and it's amazing! Especially with the hot bun it comes with....ahh-Garlic naan: really good as well. Especially with the chicken ruby sauce/pau bhaji -Chicken Berry Biryani: good, but too spicy for me. I didn't know it was a spicy dish, I had my friend eat most of this.-Mango lassi: omg!!! SOooooo goooood and creamy. I loved the little fennel seeds it comes with - added a nice touch to it. We were both pretty damn hungry coming into Dishoom but we couldn't finish everything. The portions don't look that big but it was all very filling. So glad I got to try this place in London! Probably the best real meal we had in London.",5 
391,"Seriously DELICIOUS!!I rarely enjoy Indian food, and when I do it is rare that I enjoy the entire Trinity- food, drinks, ambience.  Dishoom has nailed all three!!!",5 
392,"""You HAVE to eat Indian food while you're in London!"" is what I heard over and over again before our trip.  We only spent two days in London, but Dishoom was definitely my favorite meal while we were there.We got in line around 10pm on a Saturday night and were told the wait would be over an hour.  Several people in line decided to jump ship upon hearing this....DON'T BE THOSE PEOPLE!  We waited for maybe 20 minutes before we were seated.  I asked my friend who lives in London about this and she's had the same experience multiple times as well.  Even if the wait were an hour, the food is worth it.- Dishoom IPA: Yes, they have their own beer and it's good!- Okra Fries: Highly recommend this as an app.  If you think you don't like okra, think again.  This is not that slimy fried okra we have in the states!  The fries are crispy and really well seasoned.- Black House Daal: A signature dish for a good reason.  The flavors are incredible and we ended up ordering a second serving of garlic naan just to finish this off.- Chicken Ruby: Husband ordered this because it was mentioned in almost every single review and he loved it.  I had a couple of bites as well and ended up convincing him that should just share our dishes. HA! - Mahi Tikka: This was my order and it was SO good.  The fish is cooked perfectly, leaving it juicy, flaky, and tender.Our server was friendly and the food came out super fast.  My husband, who is normally not a huge fan of Indian food, could not stop raving about this place and has recommended it to several of his friends who were visiting London.  Now that says a lot!",5 
393,"American here. Multiple people recommended Dishoom to my husband and me when they heard we'd be in London for vacation. We waited in line for nearly an hour, but we were prepare to wait. The waitstaff was very nice. They offered us water and some sort of Indian lemon drink while we waited.Once we entered the restaurant, we knew that this was not the place to have an intimate meal. The place was packed! Our waiter was kind, but also very busy.The food was okay. The biryani and potato dish we ordered were the highlights. I wanted to enjoy my meal, but it was just too busy and hurried, so I felt rushed. I'd come again and I think I'd have a better time because I'd know what to expect.",3 
394,"Considering this was 4.5stars with over 1100 reviews, I was expecting a lot from this restaurant.  Even though this was 2 $$, it was still relatively expensive.  Food/drinks ordered:- Sweet & mango lassi: Dishoom did their own twist to the traditional lassi.  It's a bit more watered down and they added ice to the mixture as well.  The spices they added to the lassi are an acquired taste.  The mango lassi was actually more tangy than sweet.  - Okra fries: This is actually pretty good.  Crispy and quite flavorful.  I liked - The black daal is their specialty, so I got this.  It was flavorful and tasty.  I wouldn't say it blew me away, but it was still good.- Chicken ruby: tender and tasty.  Again, this is just average.- The prawn mooli was really nice.  It was light and the prawns weren't overcooked. Overall, I didn't think there was anything special about the restaurant.  If I wanted exceptional Indian food for lunch, I'd go to Tamarind @ MayFair for lunch.",3 
395,Iv heard Indian food is a must in London so I immediately knew we picked the right spot when there was a line outside the place and the wait was an hour and 10 min ! The inside is super cute and everything we ordered was AMAZING. Best samosa Iv ever had!! We also had ruby chicken that was to die for. The chai was amazing but they also had some juice with passion fruit!! Amazing!,5 
396,This was my favorite Indian cuisine experience in London. The modern chic decor with touches of tradition came together well in the basement bar. We sampled several vegetarian small plates. Get the black lentils! They were cooked perfectly and well seasoned. I will keep Dishoom on my list when I return to London.,5 
397,"It's been almost 3 months since my trip to London and I am still dreaming about their chai. We ordered the Murg Malai, lamb chops, and chicken ruby curry. ALL delicious however it is a tad bit pricey for small portions. But I guess that's London for you.My waitress was very kind and helpful on deciding what to order. Overall services seems pretty good. I'd definitely go again when I visit London again!!",4 
398,High quality no doubt but the plates and drinks were incredibly small for the lavash amount paid. In terms of quality I highly reccomend in regards to your wallet I'd venture elsewhere as there is better Indian food in London and food that is much less stealing from your purse. Atmoshphere was nice and service was good. Will only be back if I'm dragged along.,3 
399,One cant visit the Dishoom without no forms of memories thinking of how to get back again..I must say is something great and pleasant on all sides when i visited London early January 2019. It was yummy yummy and the workers were also putting all efforts ..I could say i enjoyed a lot of their appetizers for starter and main dish too...,4 
400,"We came here during our trip in London with reservations because we heard that lining up outside would take awhile. Surely, we were glad to have made reservations because it was rainy and windy that day to wait hours in line to eat. Our server was super kind and chill. He took his time to explaining items to us and recommending if things were too much or too little. When he didn't know an answer to our question, he got the answer immediately from another colleague. Super great service, cute spot, and decor. The menu was also on a newspaper-like texture and design, which was very unique to ya. I appreciated being seated in a booth, but having shared that it was my friend's birthday, we didn't receive anything special nor did anyone say ""Happy Birthday"" to them :( food was solid, and would definitely recommend trying it here: * Okra fries (4.7£) - delicious and healthy! Masala prawns - grilled and flavorful. A touch of lime squeezed on top made it even tastier. Recommend ordering.* Chefs covent garden special (12.9£) - we ordered half of this and was disappointed because we didn't pay attention to that fact that it was lamb :( we both weren't a fan of lamb but tried it and couldn't continue. Though i do believe, lamb lovers would have loved it.* House black Daal (6.50£) - surprisingly delicious! I don't think I've ever had beans like this before and it was so flavorful and rich that i smothered it all over my naan. Recommend! * Garlic naan (3.5£) - i have honestly loved naan anywhere I've gone but it's so tasty because it's freshly warmed! Must get for anything you eat here so you can dip it in all the things!* Chicken ruby (10.9£) - similar to tikka masala so i wasn't disappointed at all. I loved it and would eat this forever and ever if i could :) * Dishoom chocolate pudding (6.9£): chocolate pudding with a light chili flavored ice cream. Surprisingly not bad but i wouldn't order over and over again. Worth a try if it peaks your interests.* Mango & fennel lassi (4.2£) - yummy! Love mango lassi but could have done it without the fennel on top.* Passion fruit sharbat (3.9£) - also yummy and refreshing with the heavy meal.* Viceroy's Old fashion (9.9£) - my friend ordered this and we were both in love with the delivery. It was in a cute potion-like bottle that allows you to pour into your own glass.Overall, it wasn't super expensive, but about 93£ total. I'd say it's worth trying when visiting London. Awesome service and experience.",4 
401,"Yum yum yum! Tasty and unique (maybe unique, maybe authentic and I'm just ignorant) Indian cuisine! It's not your typical menu and actually pretty limited with the main entrees if you have something particular in mind. I got the chicken ruby curry and it was suuuuuper tasty. A bit of spice but nothing unbearable. Pair it over rice and you have a hearty, homey, meal. The lamb chops were tender and flavorful.The mango lassi was AMAZING. The garlic naan was fluffy and perfect for dipping. The fried okra was good enough.I don't think I'd wait over an hour for this. Come during lunch, the line is much better and it's the same experience!",4 
402,"This straight reminded me of some of the best indian food i tasted back in India. We went on a Sunday night and were in line for around 30 mins before they invited us in the bar area, followed by a proper table in the dining area in around 20 mins (total 50 mins)! We did not mind the wait. At the bar, we ordered Kala Khatta (non alcoholic drink,  mixed with  flavorful  spices, traditional to indian palette) and dishoom india pale. Both were great and we could not wait for the main course!For main course, we ordered lamb samosas, pau bhaji, chicken ruby, garlic naan and roomali roti. Lamb samosas were 5/5 and Pau Bhaji may be a 4/5 (i have had better). They served samosas with three different chutneys, which was amazing! Chicken ruby was tender, juicy, rich in flavors, and lip smacking good! I literally could have wiped the plate clean! So good.We ended the dinner with house tea, which was AMAZING!!Can't wait to come back.",5 
403,"They decided to celebrate my birthday in this wonderful restaurant. The manager helped with the organization of the event, the decoration of the hall, and the preparation of the menu. They agreed on prices, they are quite adequate here. The dishes are delicious! The holiday was a success !!",5 
404,"First meal in England and it was a great decision.Food: We ordered the Mahi Tikka, Spicy Lamb Chop, and Chicken Ruby. Our sides were roomalti roti and some buttered naan. All 3 dishes were amazing. The lamb was cooked perfectly. The Mahi was flaky and juicy. The chicken ruby was creamy and hearty. All three dishes combined with the sides worked perfectly well.Drinks: 1) Chai: One word. Bottomless. You can't go wrong with that. Even if it weren't unlimited, I would get a few. 2) Americano: Decent. Not the best but above average.Service: Our waiter was great. He took the time to explain to us everything on the menu. He also kept convincing me to get more chai, which I'm not sure if that was a good or bad thing... It's good in my book!I would definitely recommend coming back here!",5 
405,"We booked Dishoom for our office Christmas Party dinner because our events coordinator is totally bomb. That also means we didn't have to wait for 2 hours outside!! HAZAHHHHH!!! This is now my third visit to Dishoom, and to be quite honest, it has only gotten better and better for me. I'm not even quite sure how to describe this experience because it was so amazing. Well, they have a Christmas dinner option with different price options. We had the £30 option which included 3 starters, and 5 entrees, and an option of 1 dessert. It was family style and there was so much food. Anyway, the point is you should go for Christmas dinner because it's awesome, and if it's not Christmas, you should still go because it's delicious. See below for my fav dishes:  Bhel (crunchy puffed rice tossed with fresh pomegranate, tomato, onion, lime, tamarind, mint)- it's a lovely starter with especially nice textures and very fresh. Samosas- because samosas. Jackfruit Biryani- The jackfruit tastes like chicken- it's even got the texture of chicken and it's very confusing for a vegetarian but also a wonderful experience. Hahahahaha so weird. Anyway, the rice itself has fantastic flavour and a good amount of spice. One of my favourite dishes  fo sho. Sometimes rice makes me nervous because I feel like it'll be too dry, but this rice is so great and perfectly balanced. Mattar Paneer- Creaaaammmy baby! It's just so good. The sauce is the magical thing. It's so rich and delectable. The paneer is a nice touch, but I'd just take the sauce with the peas. Delish. House Black Daal- So, the first time I tried this dish, I wasn't crazy about it. I don't know what it was. But the second time... holy guacamole batman, this shit hit the spot. (apparently I start to sound super American when I get very enthusiastic about something and I'm now starting to notice it as I type). BUT FOR REAL GUYS THIS DISH IS SERIOUSLY LIKE THE BEST. There you go. The flavours are so deep, and it's like the flavour just gets deeper and more delicious as you eat it. Their mango Kulfi on a stick is absolutely amazing. I was so full but I managed to eat mine and two other people's because they were so creamy and delightful! ***random side note*** I was actually very upset towards the end of our meal because there was so much food left over and I didn't want it to go to waste. (We were going to a bar afterwords) I started freaking out a little bit and eating way more than normal, but wasn't hardly making a dent. Then I had the genius idea of just taking it all with us out and back home. So I did. And I brought it to work the next day and fed everyone twice! WINNING!!!!!!!!!!! Oh and of course I also kept extra for myself. I LOVE DISHOOM.",5 
406,"BEST INDIAN FOOD EVER. Hands down, no questions asked.Came here with my mom and sister and here's what we ordered:1. Prawn Koliwada (6.20)2. Dishoom Chicken Tikka (7.90)3. Paneer Tikka (7.70)4. House Black Daal (5.90)5. Chicken Berry Britannia (9.50)6. Chicken Ruby (9.50)7. Garlic Naan (2.90)8. Steamed Basmati Rice (2.90)Every single dish was outstanding! If I had to choose my top 3 dishes to order they would be the Prawn Koliwada, Dishoom Chicken Tikka, and House Black Daal. But honestly, you cannot go wrong with any dish you order! The Prawn Koliwada was so crisp and fresh and the chutney was unlike any I've ever had! I was so obsessed. Both the Dishoom Chicken Tikka and House Black Daal were so flavorful and rich in the best way. The chicken in the Dishoom Chicken Tikka was tender and juicy and cooked so nicely.The service here is fantastic and the ambiance is very fun and trendy. If you have not been here before and you're visiting London, Dishoom is a must! My family and I arrived here around 4pm and waited for about an hour! Apparently the wait is much longer near dinner time so if you're flexible I would definitely come as early as possible! Would love to come back to Dishoom the next time I am in town.",5 
407,Dishoom.. We need you in California. Since when did Indians make breakfast rolls with the naan? Have I been living in a cave or is this a UK thing?!? Cmon bruv!!A warm flat naan with some amazing smoked bacon coated with a sweet sauce and a perfectly runny egg where the yolk bursts when you take a bite?! And the little bits of mint that compliment the savory sweetness perfectly?! Wow.. I could eat this for breakfast any day of the week. I thought this place was awesome but its just based on one breakfast item. They give you a little red sweet jelly type of sauce to dip it in. Sooooooo goood!! OH MY DAYS! Lol..,4 
408,"This was our first ever Indian/Irani food experiance ever and it didn't disappoint! First we started off with drinks since we had a 20 min wait (no biggie on a saturday at 9). I got the cobada colada (I think, it's a tongue twister!) It was absolutely delish and tasted like a vacation in a glass.Once seated, our waitress was incredibly kind and recommended a bunch of stuff. We went with the black daal, chicken ruby, gunpowder potatoes, rice, and garlic naan. All were so flavorful and tasty. Our favorite dish was the chicken ruby. All dishes are meant to be shared. Everything is also very reasonably priced in my opinion (nothing we got was over 10.)  For a restaurant with over 1200 Yelp reviews, I see why! A unique and exciting food experiance.",5 
409,"When we were planning our trip to London, I knew Indian food had to be something we ate while we were there. I looked at many places until I found Dishoom. The reviews looked promising so we chose the Covent Garden location based on preference of where we wanted to be. When we arrived we saw a long line. It was almost like the lines you see to get into a bar/nightclub. I had been warned about the lines from other reviews but was surprised by what we saw. We were immediately greeted by a staff member who took our names down and apologized for the wait. He said it was going to be an hour and half. Yes an hour and a half. But we were determined and everyone else in line seemed to be in good spirits so we got comfortable and waited. They do take reservations for parties of 6 or more. The staff offered us some chai tea and green tea to sip on while we waited. The line moved and when we made it to the front, we were greeted with another staff member who led us to the bar. From there we ordered drinks and then a staff member came and took our drinks to our table. We were taken care of by 4 people even before we sat down. The restaurant's vibe is Our server came and made recommendations. By that point, we had already decided on what we wanted because we had plenty of time to look at it. We ordered Chicken Tikka, Chicken Biryani, rice, regular naan and garlic naan, and raita (yogurt sauce). The food was so delicious. The food comes out family style which is typical in Indian culture. Everything was well made, flavorful, and a good amount of spice. The service was fantastic too. Like I said, from the moment we got in line until we left, we were well taken care off. Definitely worth it.",5 
410,"I hate to admit it, but I don't think my taste buds really care for Indian cuisine.  However, on my most recent trip to London, I couldn't ignore the fact that this place received raving reviews about their food.  My boyfriend and I came here for a late breakfast before we headed out to explore the city.  We both had the bacon naan roll and it was one of the most delicious things I've eaten!  I was really surprised by how yummy everything was, from the pillowy softness of the bread, to the savoury flavour of the bacon that was complimented nicely with some sweetness from the tomato jam. I'm not sure when we will be back in London (hopefully soon, after we visit some other destinations on our list), but I would definitely come back here again!!",5

412,"We were told Dishoom was the best Indian food in London, and Indian food is pretty rampant in these parts.  It was pretty tasty (after a few days of eating sub par food, since during the holidays most things are closed).  While most of the dishes had good flavor, there were some misses.  Grab a few dishes of curry, naan, tikka. The biryani is a good staple.  Some of the food has good heat to it, so don't forget to pair it with some raita to cool it down.All in all, this is a great place for groups.  A good time and pretty good curry.",4 
413,We were beyond happy with our experience at Dishoom! The food was excellent and plentiful. We did the preplanned menu for a party of 10 and it was a great experience. The staff was also very accommodating and provided excellent service.,5 
414,"Even though we had to w for 1 hour it still gets a 5.The service, food, drinks and atmosphere were all first rate. They handle the tables rely well so the wait time is accurate. No reservations so pick your time carefully otherwise prepare to Q.",5 
415,I was recommended Dishoom by a fellow volunteer for my layover in London on my way back home from Greece. The design inside is both elegant and traditional. The atmosphere is both warm and welcoming. The food is flavorful and right to texture and proportion. I did order more than I could eat though since I was only party of one but wanted to try a couple of things. I'd definitely come back one day if I'm in London.,4 
416,"I never thought I'd say an hour and a half wait would be worth any meal - but it is at Dishoom! Now this wait was partially my bad, no they don't take reservations past 5:45pm for small parties, but my partner and I showed up at 6:30 on a Saturday night - aka peak time. The staff was so friendly during this wait, they even pass out hot chai tea! (and you can grab some beers from a convenience store around the corner while you wait as long as one person stays in line)Now for the food: my partner and I split the lamb samosas, a lamb chop, the house black daal, the fish tikka, chicken curry, and garlic naan. Our socks were blown off by each dish after the next. The fish was a favorite of mine (and a recommendation from a loyal regular we met in line) it was melt in the mouth soft, like butter, and the seasonings were just impeccable (on everything)! The lamb chops were tender, the samosas were perfectly crispy and flavorful, the black daal was something not to miss, and the curry was lick the bowl delicious. We finished our meal with the chocolate pudding and chili ice cream dessert, and it was the perfect juxtaposition of hot and cold, spicy and sweet, rich and light. Everything consumed at Dishoom was the best I've ever eaten - no lie, no exaggeration. If you like Indian food, or even if you don't, get your butt down here! (but be prepared for a wait)",5 
417,"My husband and I had lunch at this location the other day.  We arrived just before noon.  We did not have a reservation, but the hostess said that was no problem.  She would seat us at the end of a long table for 10 people, but said she would need it back by 1:30.  This was not an issue for us, but it did seem a bit odd.  I've only been to a few places that have told me I can have a table for a limited amount of time, but most of the time it is because the restaurant is so amazing that they are overbooked, so although in one sense it bothered me, in another sense I was now even more excited to eat here because, dang this place must be good.  For drinks my husband ordered a watermelon cooler which he described as a watermelon mojito, no alcohol.  I was debating between a chai and a lassi.  I love both, but I have a tendency to fill up on lassis before my food arrives.  However, there was a guy at another table with this gorgeous pink drink.  When I asked the server what it was and he said the rose and cardamom lassi, I knew I had to have it.  To be honest, it was my favorite thing I consumed at this meal.  It was heavenly.  It had just the right amount of sweetness and the a gorgeous flavor of roses, but it did sort of fill me up.  For entree my husband ordered the lamb chops.  He saw a thousand things he wanted to order on the menu and was having a terrible time deciding, but once I started showing him pictures on Yelp he knew that is what he wanted and he said they were incredible.  I'm not super into red meat right now.  My pregnancy has largely turned me off to most red meat,  but they did look gorgeous.  I ordered the chicken ruby.  Here's my issue, it was one of only 2 curries on the menu.  I mean it is kind of cool to go to an Indian restaurant that has different stuff and when we were in India most restaurants had curries, and tandoori, and biriyani, but I really felt like 2 curries was a super limited selection.  There was no korma, xacuti, vindaloo, madras, etc.  For my personal taste this lack of selection of sauces was a bummer.  The chicken ruby was very good, but far from the best I've ever had.  It tasted like butter chicken to me.  The spicy flavor didn't kick in until the very last minute.  I ordered it with basmati rice which was fine, but in no way special, and roti, which again was fine, but not special.  With his lamb my husband ordered the black daal which everyone raved about and we found to be lackluster.  These were far from the best lentils we've ever had.  The atmosphere of the restaurant was a bit odd too.  We sat upstairs and I am glad we did.  When I went downstairs it was like a whole different restaurant.  It was loud, crowded and cramped.  The upstairs was a bit like that, but not to that extent.  Finally, the prices were a bit steep as well.  After, Gordon Ramsay's restaurant, this was the second most expensive meal we ate in London, so it is pretty pricey.  We definitely enjoyed it, but I don't think we enjoyed it that much and for all those who say this place is worth the wait, I am going to have to politely disagree.  Again, it is good, but it is not outstanding.  Perhaps I am spoiled by my vast selection of Indian at home or by the fact that I have traveled and spent time in India.  I had really high expectations for Indian food in London and this didn't really meet them.",3 
418,"It seems like dishoom grew in popularity since I last visited in 2014 and I'm not surprised! My friends and family have heard me rave about it for years and I still stand by the fabulous menu! My husband and I visited the covent garden location on a Friday evening back in April - literally during peak dinner hours. I knew we would have about a 2 hour wait so we made sure to have a snack beforehand. Loved that the host outside was handing out piping hot glasses of chai, it helped make the wait in the rain a little better. We were finally seated in the downstairs dining area and it was bustling with people, just as I remember it on Friday evenings. When I was in grad school, dishoom was my weekly indulgence of Indian street food and I had the menu memorized forward and backwards. I liked seeing that most of my favorites were still on the menu - black dal, gunpowder potatoes, paneer tikka and murgh malai. We tried a new dish this time, which I really enjoyed as well, the goan shrimp curry. Everything tasted fresh and so delicious! I still feel like this is some of the best Indian food you can find in London!",5 
419,"Waited 1.5hr on a Sunday night to get seated with 3 friends.  They came out with comp shots of lemonades and dates and grapes which was nice.We ordered fried okras, the far far (like prawn crackers texture) and Dishoom calamari (breaded fried calamari) for appetizers.  The fried okras were so good we ordered a 2nd one!My friends ordered the chicken ruby, chicken berry Britannia with biryani rice and prawn curry.  I had the Murgh Malai (marinated grilled chicken thigh meat).All dishes were flavorful.  The flavor of the biryani rice dish with the sweet berries tasted very good.  The Murgh Malai pieces were tender wth wonderful flavor.Would I come back to eat?  Yes - if I don't have to wait for 1.5hr.  That really took it out of us standing there (luckily it was a nice balmy night).",4 
420,"Wife found this place on Yelp which has over a thousand reviews and 4.5 stars. After several Tube rides we got here and was told the wait would be an hour. However we waited only about 40 minutes and was seated. While in line we chatted with a family from Seattle who had been there and loved it, and highly recommend the fried okra appetizer. They were right about the restaurant being worth the wait and about the okra! We ordered Chicken Ruby which was like chicken Tikka masala, and it was super delicious. We also ordered another curry and it was good, but not as good as the orange curry. We also ordered lamb and chicken tandoori and both were flavorful and tender without being dry. The plain and garlic naan were great to dip the curry. Overall a delicious experience, definitely recommended and definitely will return next time we are in London!",5 
421,"Amazing! I've heard about fishhook through friends and bloggers on Instagram. My cousins and I came for dinner one night and brunch 2 days later. While I preferred the dinner, both were good. The drinks were delicious. We ordered a variety of things and the most notable and delicious once's were the spicy chili toast, the dhal (which I normally don't love but it was so good!), the okra frys, the chicken ruby and lamb chops. The chops were so juicy and tender. For breakfast, we really enjoyed the chicken egg burji and the chai, which is endless.There are no reservations for dinner, there's a wait outside at a first come first serve basis. While you wait in line, someone does offer your water and lemonade which I thought was really nice. We came on a Wednesday night as a group of 5 and waited about a hour and half. You can make reservations for breakfast which was really easy to make.",5 
422,"This place was the best restaurant I went to during my visit to London! I loved the ambiance, the variety of food, the proportions and the price. I had the paneer tikka roll which was amazing and perfectly cooked. My brother had the Ruby chicken and loooved it. Said it was one of the best chicken dishes he's had. I recommend going if you love Indian or want to try Indian food. The hype is real.",5 
423,"So, in advance of going to London, I was told to go to Dishoom as it was the best Indian restaurant. Since I was hearing this from another Indian person who is family, I felt I had to go if it was possible. Considering this location is right near Trafalgar Square, it was quite perfect to stop by in our travels.I was told in advance that the restaurant doesn't take reservations. Apparently it does. We arrived and were told there was a 40-minute wait. So, we put our name on the list, said screw it, and just walked around the general area. When we returned 30 minutes later, our name had already been called and they moved on. It was an annoying start. So we had to wait another 40 minutes that was actually 30 on their patio before being entered into Dishoom.We waited for a little while longer in their bar area before being seated. The vibe in Dishoom is pretty cool. It's packed and we were seated with other guests at long family-style tables. Okay, let me get to the point: the food is some of the best Indian food I've ever had at a restaurant. The house black daal is unbelievable. They claim it is ""cooked over 24 hours for extra harmony"" and you can taste the preparation. The harmony is delightful. For that alone, and at 6 pounds, it is worth going. The other items I got were the okra fries and the paneer tikka, both were delightful as well and I'm sure the meat options are good too for those interested.You could easily break your wallet if your eyes get too big for your stomach as everything looks and is delicious. However, for 2 people, we simply ordered these 3 items and garlic naan and it sufficed in the late afternoon after a long day of walking. To me, it was certainly manageable pricing for quite good food and ambiance in London.I still will rate Dishoom 5 stars but there were two downfalls. I would say the reservation and seating situation was just a little unclear and odd given the popularity of the restaurant. I also think the service was a bit odd at times. I mean it's odd for me as an Indian person to have a white guy tell me about Indian dishes, but hey, that's just me and I know that's his job. But, more so, our server just kind of disappeared at one point without telling us and another server seemed to have no choice but to start serving us and handle our bill when she realized that guy was just gone. But, the reservations/service situation aside, Dishoom was that good that it didn't matter. You should definitely check it out if in London and especially because I'd expect as a tourist you'd be visiting this busy area of the city at some point anyway.",5 
424,"Dishoom! Lives up to its expectation and ratings... Is it an overpriced place? YES.. Is is always crowded? YES.. Does it live up to all the hype it's created? YES.. Is it worth it? Dishoom! YES!Thanks to fellow Yelper's who made the decision extremely easy for what to order... Priced a bit on the expensive side for the really small portions you get... it might annoy you to find a small little bowl of Okra Fries (£3.70) and Prawn Koliwada (£5.90).. But have a bit of these extremely well seasoned appetizers... and ... DISHOOM! They got it spot on.. Really nice flavor and you'll definitely enjoy it!For entrees... Chicken Ruby is clearly a winner. We saw a few tables order Biryani and Choley Bhatura too; but most of them were hogging on the really delicious (albeit smaller portions) of this dish.. again, priced a bit on the steeper end at £8.20. Roomali Roti's go extremely well.. so definitely recommend that!Few things to remember.. they don't take reservations, so be prepared to wait! We waited ~50 minutes on a Wed night at 7:20. After we got in, they strategically send you downstairs to their bar where they'd expect you to spend a few more £££'s on drinks.. in about 15 minutes, you'd be taken to your table. For a place already minting money, this was a bit unnecessary in my opinion!Service wise, no complaints! In fact, the food comes out really quick after placing your order. We got our food within 10 minutes! Definitely a must experience place for the Desi & Videsi crowd ;-)",5 
425,"Go ahead, call me boring. When I was in London in January, I ate here three times. Note, I was in London for three days. Well, I'm back in the UK and my first meal, Dishoom. I didn't even try to order something new. I went with what I got last time. okra fries, garlic naan, and the infamous Black Dahl. Omg, I nearly forgot the homemade chai drink. It's as close to True Indian saffron tea as I can find.There is always a line outside. They do not have reservations. I don't care if it's a two-hour wait, its worth every minute of standing. I'm convinced that Dishoom is my favorite restaurant of all time.",5 
426,"This place was a disappointment. More specifically, if I had paid half of what I'd paid, it would have been acceptable. But I have had much better Indian food, with bigger portion sizes, for less.My sister and I came here right before 5pm and waited for around 45 minutes to be seated. We ordered the Pav Bhaji, mango lassi, dosa, Ruby paneer, and Ruby chicken. The Pav Bhaji was okay but not super flavorful. The bread didn't taste very fresh either. The mango lassi was good and not too sweet. The Ruby paneer was flavorless - I was surprised at how little spice they used. The Ruby chicken curry was good but ridiculously overpriced - the sauce was tomato-y and lightly spiced, but the chicken didn't seem to be marinated. And the dosa was not flaky at all. Even the rice was a disappointment. Slightly mushy and not at all what I would expect.Side note - the decor and atmosphere in the restaurant was good, but the thick incense smell was very irritating for my asthma. A lot of people have asthma, so it might be a good idea to not burn so much incense inside. It also made me wonder if they were trying to cover up something. Why not let the smell of the food shine through?I'd like to emphasize that I've had way better Indian food in small towns. I would expect much more from a big city like London and from the hype that this place gets.",2 
427,"A no flair very casual however very nice experience. Loved this place, great vibe great service great atmosphere and the food that goes along. First off I was happy that all the staff speaks English.  Being from Southern California and experiencing disappointments with the lack of quality and lack of the English language in almost all  Indian restaurants these guys need to move to California. I had the basic Chicken Tikal masala, a vegetarian dish which consisted of broccoli ( well prepared ) some bread , raita,  salad , beer , desert , tea . Good food, attentive service, clean what more. Great job guys",4 
428,"Who knew London was known for Indian food? Not me. Indian food has been on my to-do list for quite some time and this definitely checked it off the list. I loved it!Upon reading many reviews I had a strong idea that we would be waiting in the queue for quite some time. We arrived as early as we could and joined queue 1-which gets you the ability to join the real queue 2. Once you get through that line you finally get to enter and wait a little longer with a buzzer at the bar. So all in all the wait was LONG. and you are not allowed to wait elsewhere. They did bring us a free chai latte inline 2 which was great. We sampled all sorts of things trying to steer clear of too much spice. The attendant in queue 2 helped us through the menu and all of her recommendations were spot on. Our waitress also helped with her favorites. We grabbed a handful of plates to split between two of us and loved getting to try different things. The manager even stopped by to ask what we thought, gave us some history of the restaurant and was extremely friendly. All in all, I dug the vibe, the food, and the staff. If you're in London give this a try. You will get an authentic Indian food experience.",5 
429,"Had an amazing first Dishoom meal here recently, and very happy to recommend it to all. We came for breakfast, and I sincerely love the vibe and decor of the place. Our service was friendly and very attentive, and they kept the house chai flowing which was fantastic! We got the Kejriwal and the Keema Per Eedu. Both were quite tasty, especially the Keema (which had a stronger flavor). I was sad to not have enough stomach space to try out some of the naans. Most of all, I loved the decor - from all of the photographs, to even the decor in the restrooms, to the giant clock going backwards (""it's on Bombay time"" - our server) it really has a lovely atmosphere that feels special and unique.",5 
430,"Delicious! This place is in demand. I went to the one near Trafalgar Sq. It is a touristy area but it is delicious and worth it. Bombay style Indian food. We got cheesy naan and chutney, okra fries (these are probably the best thing on the menu???), rice and kebab, and black daal. For drinks we tried chai and watermelon sharbat. There could be a long wait. We got in and were seated right away. Right after us a long line formed, Disney-style. I wish I could eat here every day.",5 
431,"This was one of our better meals while in London.I had heard great things about Dishoom, so I bookmarked this restaurant prior to my trip to London. Unfortunately, the only time that I could visit was during the morning, so we opted to try the food prior to our trip to Buckingham Palace. Luckily, we got there before the brunch crowd, so we were able to be seated right away. The menu didn't have a ton of choices, but I decided on the Big Bombay breakfast, which included eggs, beans, sausage, bacon and some rolls. It was a relatively simple breakfast (and a lot of food), but everything was nicely cooked and flavorful. Paired with some orange juice, this was a good start to the day exploring London. I would definitely want to return, next time I am in London, to try dinner.",4 
432,Amazing food and amazing service. I've been multiple times with family and friends.,5 
433,My favorite Indian in London. Drinks and everything we ordered was great. They also did well working with restrictive diets and were helpful making suggestions. Worth the wait.,5 
434,"Not a big Indian food fan but I was told I just had to have Indian food when in London and this place was the place to go.  Got to the restaurant on our first night there, a bit jet lagged and tired only to realize they had an hour line to wait in outside.  We decided to wait it out.  Time passed by quickly talking to friendly people in line, and the restaurant sent someone out to give free cups of chai tea and mint tea to those of us waiting in line, which was a nice touch.We actually were seated after only a 30 minute wait, and we ordered the vegetable Somosa appetizer which was a veggie and spice mixture inside a small pastry.  It was very flavorful.  Followed this with the Ruby Chicken, which was pieces of tender chicken in a red curry sauce and an order of their garlic Naan.  The chicken was flavorful and everything you'd expect a red curry dish to be.  The Naan was good but sadly did not taste of garlic.    Although Indian food is still not my favorite I did enjoy the food here and would recommend .",4 
435,The food is extremely tasty. the ambience is not that great though. the service is good!,4 
436,"Two different friends recommended this restaurant before my trip to London and I'm so glad I listened to them.  My friends and I showed up on a Monday night to find an hour wait.  We had theatre tickets and couldn't wait so came back the next day for lunch and decided to stick out the 45 minute wait.  All of us agreed this was the best Indian food we've had.  My personal favorites were the grilled pineapple and paneer and the ruby chicken (a traditional curry dish).  We tried the grilled potatoes, samosas, chicken tikka, rice, naan, and a salad.  Nothing disappointed.",5 
437,"Disclaimer: I'm just a simple dude from Southern California.The hype of Dishoom is so very real. The food is amazing. It's well balanced, cooked perfectly, and is incredibly appetizing. My mouth is watering just thinking about the food.The servers were nice and I felt like I was eating at a trendy restaurant in LA. I think it's a great combination of the great Indian food you can find in London and the service you should come to expect at a trendy LA restaurant. I remember waiting almost an hour for the meal and normally, I wouldn't do it. But I had to see the hype. It was definitely worth it. I recommend Dishoom if you're around the area!",5 
438,"Not an Indian food expert. We came here because we know London has amazing Indian food. My Indian friends told me it is much better than the food back home. From our yelp search, we made reservations here.Two stories and we would recommend reservations given how popular it is. We decided to be brave and order a bunch of things we never tried. PAU BHAJI (A bowl of mashed vegetables with hot buttered, home-made bun, Chowpatty Beach style. No food is more Bombay. (V)(S)4.50) - This was boxed on their menu and I wanted some veggies. This was our favorite item! It was so flavorful! Can't believe its veggies!AWADHI LAMB (The lamb is prepared with stock and spices, then layered with rice and cooked in traditional 'dum' style. (S)10.50) - My husband loves BIRYANI so we ordered this. We ordered yogurt to go with it. They gave us a big bowl of it! The yogurt was really refreshing and delicious but unfortunately the biryani was so-so. Not as flavorful. HOUSE BLACK DAAL (A Dishoom signature dish -- dark, rich, deeply flavoured. It is cooked over 24 hours for extra harmony. (V)5.90) - Also boxed on their menu. It was our second favorite item. It is made from what I think is mung beans (or similar). You don't like mung beans then I wouldn't order this. DISHOOM CHICKEN TIKKA (A family recipe, using a marinade of sweet vinegar, not yoghurt. Laced with ginger juice, turmeric, garlic and green chilli. (S)7.90) - As close to the famous chicken tikka marsala you will get here. Came with 4 big pieces of chicken. Its not as creamy but good. It was a bit sweet for me. Garlic naan- we got one. You can get it buttered or not. It was good. Overall, it was a good meal. Unfortunately, I don't eat Indian food that often so I am no expert. Flavors were very different but good from the Indian food I've had in the States.Plenty of restrooms that is pretty nice.",5 
439,"It's the BEST Indian food that I have tried so far! Worth the wait! Host and servers were super friendly and considerate! The server not only moved the big party away from us for more privacy, but she also apologized for the noise at the end! Ruby chicken was crazily tasty！！",5 
440,"My first time in London, first meal in London, and first time stepping foot in a modernized traditional Bombay-style cafe. Dishoom is beyond any Indian food I have tasted in the U.S. and has elevated my Indian food experience and a spectacular culinary treat. Despite the long queue, staff were very welcoming and friendly. At one point, the host came out to personally chat with us and the hostess even offered hot Indian tea and beverages for the awaiting guests. Well known for their breakfast and buzz for their fried eggs and Bacon Naan Roll, we arrived for dinner instead. Our waiter, Ali, was so helpful in explaining the menu, as everything just sounded so inviting and delicious. We ordered a full table, starting with the Bhang Lassi and Mango & Fennel Lassi drinks. Indian food is best eaten with Lassi as it balances the heat and spice from the curry. For the entrees, we tried the House Black Daal, Chicken Ruby (tender chicken in makhani sauce), Sheekh Kabab (grilled lamb) and dipping Raita (minty cucumber yogurt). I would recommend getting two orders of the stonefire Naan or the steamed Basmati Rice for dipping and mopping the rich, silky curry sauces. Ali also brought out 3 house-made dipping sauces, which really brings out the flavor of the meat dishes. Mouthwatering food and drinks, stellar customer service, clean and charming restaurant decor, all located right in the heart of London. Dishoom is so worth the 13 hour flight from San Diego. Cheers/Chiyars!",5 
441,"My husband and I came here for dinner on a recent trip to the UK. We arrived around 5:30 PM and had to wait over an hour and a half to get in... But it was totally worth it. It was a cold and blustery day (don't worry, this isn't the start of a Gothic romance), and the waitstaff kindly provided mini cups of steaming hot chai and mint tea to warm us while we waited. Once we got in, my husband and I were seated downstairs at a tiny two seater table. Our waiter helped us make sense of the extensive menu and together, we put together a lovely meal. We had the lamb biryani (best I've ever had) paired with a light yogurt dip to cut the heat. We also has veggie samosas and fried okra. YUM. Everything was super and I was extremely impressed with the quality of the food. We washed down our delicious meal with a glass of mango lassi (also terrific). If you have the chance to visit, please do. It's well worth the wait. Oh, and the WC was pretty clean, too.",5 
442,"Bistro-style Bombay restaurant with excellent food, great service and wonderful late-night international vibe. Fresh Nan constantly being made in the kitchen. Much care taken to deliver very flavorful dishes including Tandoori, curries, biryanis and house specialty daal. Reasonable prices. Great drinks. What's there not to like?",5 
443,"Went here twice in two days - first for breakfast then for dinner. We arrived a bit early for dinner, around 530pm. Good thing, because by 630 there was a line snaking out the door. I had the chicken biryani. It was very very good - the rice was slightly over cooked, so I would not rate it the best I've ever had (tbh it's pretty hard to beat a biryani made by a specialty mom and pop shop), but the service and atmosphere more than made up for any slight shortcomings in food. The waiter recommended pairing it with their special gin tonic, which was a spot-on combination. Bottom line - I would come back here again and again just for the experience and wow factor. Very happy with Dishoom.",5 
444,"Found this place on Yelp while picking up some discount theatre tickets, and since we love Indian food and we heard the Indian food in London was amazing...this had to be tried. And oh boy was it delicious! We came in around 2:45pm local on a Friday, so it was a short wait...but after ordering the food (with some recommendations from the server), it was completely worth it. Specifically, the Chicken Ruby (their 'makhani' style dish) was off the chain, the House Black Daal was so so tasty, and the Lamb Boti Kabab was perfectly seasoned - extremely balanced and still juicy. Even the garlic naan was freshly glistening with butter!The only slight disappointment was the Prawn Koliwada - I think we expected something slightly different, and while it wasn't bad once the main dishes came out, we completely ignored it and crushed everything. This place is so so good!",5 
445,"This was probably the best Indian food I've had at a restaurant outside of India. Honestly, it's on par with the restaurants actually in India! Came with a small group for dinner after 5+ people recommended I head here before leaving London. The queue was a bit long and we were told it would be an ho wait, but we persevered. We ended up waiting outside for 30 minutes then being moved downstairs to the bar and given a buzzer to wait for our table. The buzzer rang after 10 minutes and we were in our way. We ordered the chicken tikka, chicken ruby, lamb samosas, garlic naan, lamb biryani, mutton pepper fry (chef's Covent garden special), okra fries, and lamb boti kabab.  Everything tasted amazing. All of the meats were well seasoned and grilled to perfection but still moist. This was my first time having okra fries and they were delicious. I'd say the absolute must haves were the mutton pepper fry, chicken tikka, lamb biryani, and ruby chicken (roughly in that order). The service was amazing and the restaurant was lively. It was a great experience and I definitely need to go back for more!",5 
446,"It wasn't even 5 pm and this place had a line outside already.  Granted, this resto is smack dab in the middle of tourist mecca in London, so you really can't fault it for brimming with tourists. With all the accolades it has received at Yelp, Zagat and TripAdvisor to name a few, a long wait here is inevitable. We got lucky though 'cause we only waited about 45 minutes to get seated (with only 6 couples of in front of us or so it seemed).  Reservations for dinner are only taken for groups of 6 diners or more.  But here's the 411 on the seating process, just in case you think you're close to being seated when you reach the front of the line (you're not): You stand in line outside, and when you get to the front of the line, they may call you in inside and sit on the chair by the hostess podium, or they may just call you in and lead you directly to the bar downstairs to their basement, where they encourage you to get a drink, and where you have to wait some more. We ordered a couple of drinks (a Virgin Bombay Colada for me and a Nimbu Pani for the hubby), and studied the menu while waiting another 20 minutes down there. We were eventually seated just on the other side of the bar area.  This place is tight, so you will definitely be in on the conversation of the people next to you, whether you like it or not.  Here are the items we ordered:Naan--a bit disappointing.  It wasn't piping hot when it reached our table.  No blisters on it like it usually has and it wasn't elastic in texture.  More like a flatbread than a traditional naan. We should have sent it back and gotten a hot off the oven one.Dishoom Calamari--nice flavor, tender, but a little greasy.  A small portion but perfect for two people sharing. Kacchi Lamb Biryani--good dish, nicely spiced, very tender lamb chunks underneath the rice.  Kacchi Lamb Chops--ordered and enjoyed by the hubby.  The marinade has penetrated the meat and you get a very flavorful and tender bite. Enough for 1 person.Raita--good accompaniment for all the dishes we had and will cool your palate.We did not have dessert.  We were just too full from our dinner.  Service was friendly and good.  When we were standing in line outside the restaurant, a staff member came by with small glasses of Nimbu Pani (essentially a lemonade).  It was a warm day, so it was definitely welcome and refreshing. They're open for breakfast, lunch, and dinner, so they don't close down at all in the afternoon.  If you can go in the afternoon, the wait times may be better.  When we were leaving the restaurant, the line was pretty bad.  There must have been over 15 parties in line. As good as their food is, I wouldn't wait in that line.  You're better off trying a mom and pop Indian restaurant that probably has as good, if not better food than this restaurant.",4 
447,"SO GOOD. When we have friends visiting from the states, Dishoom is always my first recommendation. Yes, you should expect to wait in line (usually 1 hour but always depends) and I promise you, it is so worth it in the end. If you want to try for a shorter wait, I'd aim to get there no later than 4:45pm. Without a doubt, you've got to try the Black Dahl (creamy, flavorful and unlike any other dahl I've had. It's one of their specialties!). I also highly recommend the Pau Bhaji. It's vegetarian dish, and I wasn't too keen on the description but a waiter once recommended it so we thought we'd give it a try. Now it's a must-order every time we go! And the drinks!  Highly recommend the Hoppy Butter Paanch. It is exactly what I'd imagine a Butter Beer from Harry Potter tastes like :) Five stars all the way.",5 
448,"Food: 4.0/5.0Service: 3.5/5.0Value: 3.5/5.0Decor: 3.5/5.0Overall: 4.0/5.0I was half expecting something completely amazing but half expecting to be disappointed with my first Dishoom experience given the general accuracy of Yelp but then also the reputation of cuisine in this city.  Lo and behold, Dishoom came in smack in between - the food was indeed done quite well, and I think there is price that the proprietors can take but choose not to.  However, I would posit that the rating would be just a tad lower in certain other cities.  #true",4 
449,"I like the food dishoom has but the wait times tend to be ridiculous so would I Walt to eat the food there? No, but if there is no wait I'll gladly eat there The garlic Naan, paneer Tikka and paneer vegetable happen to be my favorite but come on guys, you need to add a malai kofta or something to your vegetarian menu",4 
450,"Interesting art deco interior design and great service. Apart from a special old fashion that I ordered, nothing is too impressive IMO. The food is rather mediocre than special.",3 
451,"Would you wait for 1 hour in horrid weather to get Indian food? Well, we did. So this was apparently supposed to be the best Indian place in London and I figured I had to try it on my weekend visit. Got there at 6 pm and the place had a huge line outside. No, they do not let you put your name on the list and go for a stroll. You have to stand in the line, rain, wind or shine. They do bring you chai and sherry while you're waiting though.Once inside, the ambiance was beautiful. They have amazing Indian decor. We ordered the chicken ruby, dal makhani, kheema pav and roomali roti. Every thing was spot on except Chicken ruby. Chicken ruby was sweet for my taste. Service was good and prices were very affordable.",4 
452,We came on a Sunday evening after 6 and there was a wait for 45 mins for seating 2 people. This location I felt was quite huge as compared to the other two. Dishoom is located in the heart of the carnaby street and has some delicious dishes to offer. The reason why I give this place a 4 star is that the wait is much longer anytime and any day of the week and there are very limited vegetarian options to try from. This is a street side food joint without a twist straight from Bombay as they put it! The food is good delicious but I still feel this place is a bit overrated. There are only 4-5 veggie small plate dishes to choose from but all are very flavorful. Still wish they had more vegetarian options to choose from. Coming back again if I crave for some street side Indian food.,4 
453,"Before we embarked on our trip to London, literally everybody we spoke to said we had to try Dishoom. With hype comes the slight chance of disappointment if it doesn't deliver, but guys, the Dishoom hype is real! We ordered the ruby chicken, which by the way, was so good we ordered two! It was basically a flavor explosion of zesty tomato and coconut creaminess. We paired that with cheese naan which you should absolutely order. We finished that off with the okra fries ( which I would trade for French fries any day, and that's saying a lot!). The entire meal at Dishoom was so memorable that I still dream about it from time to time :)",5 
454,We went to dishoom for breakfast. It was a really nice place with a great ambience. We are from Mumbai so Irani cafe resonates with us. The ambience is lovely and the menu for egg breakfasts are phenomenal.For non egg eating vegetarians this place is a bit tricky as there isn't much. All in all still a very good experience. Very reasonbaly priced for breakfast.,4 
455,"Wow....  When in Rome.....  or rather when in London you have to try Indian food.  Simply outstanding.  I sat outside so won't comment much on ambiance or decor although it looked great from what I could gather....  but the food was insane.I had the gunpowder potatoes which were perfectly prepared, and covered in scallions.  Deep flavor, well cooked...  just perfect.Chicken ruby is a must try... amazing flavor and rich sauce but the chicken is expertly cooked.  Moist and flavorful. Lamb kabob was also amazing and was another star of the show...  I finished off with the cheese naan and together all this made a perfect concert..Amazing place and if you like Indian food you simply must come here and brave the wait.",5 
456,"Wow. I don't really eat Indian food much or at least, I'm not an expert on it, but wow. Dishoom was one of the highlights of my trip to London and, the food and service I received were worth the long lines.As everyone else is saying, I would recommend coming early to avoid the wait. I came a little before 6:00 pm and had to wait almost 45 minutes - mind you, I was by myself. The waitresses will also provide you with a little hot drink (chai tea?) while you wait outside. Good thing some fellow Americans were also waiting in line; they told me what to try and order as I had no idea what to get. They recommended me the Chicken Ruby with some Naan and a side of Basmati Rice. I also ordered a delicious and sweet Mango & Fennel Lassi. Everything was tasty. The Chicken was flavorful, rich, and deliciously spiced. The Naan and Rice complemented the Chicken and the sauce perfectly. Oh, and the dips...! Amazing. For 1 person, that was a lot of food. Plus, the service was exceptional. Would I recommend it? Of course. If you're visiting London for the first time, Dishoom is definitely a place to try!",4 
457,"I took a little tour of London through an Airbnb experience and my tour guide was Indian-American so I asked her for the best Indian restaurant recommendation and she sent me to Dishoom. I ended up going for a late lunch/ early dinner, probably around 3:30-4:00pm. That was definitely the perfect timing because as I was leaving the line to get on the list was out the door. I was able to be seated right away. Dishoom is a lot of smaller plates, meant to be shared. I was traveling solo but that wasn't going to stop me from trying several items. I started with Lamb Samosas, these had the perfect balance of filling vs. pastry. They were so full of flavor. I dipped them in the trio of sauces they provided as well, so delicious. Next, I had the House Black Daal with garlic naan, and the recommended bowl of greens. The Black Daal is the signature dish, so of course I had to get it. I'm honestly not even sure what was in it but it was so freaking good. It was packed full of flavor and it paired perfectly with the garlic naan. This was a nice serving portion as well. It filled me up but if shared with someone else I would recommend maybe another dish to share. The greens were also SO full of flavor. I was shocked how good these were. I was very glad the server recommended them. At the end of my meal, I believe the manager came to ask me how everything was. I appreciated him taking the time to come over and check on me. I ordered the Chocolate Pudding and a glass of Chai. The manager gave me the Chai on the house, which was very kind of him. They chocolate pudding was so delicious, I love the hint of chili at the end of each bite. The Chai was by far the best I've ever had. I posted a picture on my facebook and my friend who lives in India said that the Chai was served exactly how it would be served in India, in a glass, not a tea/coffee mug. Overall, I felt like I had a genuine culinary experience. It was the best Indian food I have ever had. If I lived in London this place would take all my money because I would eat here all the time!! I highly recommend Dishoom if you're in London.",5 
458,Came here after seeing the reviews. The waiting line was LONG but the food a little disappointed maybe because it was hyped up so much plus i like Indian food when its spicy and this place was a little bland for my taste buds Ambiance - GREAT Pricing - Average Taste - Average Service - Good,3 
459,"Dishoom was our first dinner in London! It was beautiful weather so standing in line for about 40 minutes didn't seem like a chore! They provided us with lemonade in line and then sent us inside to the next part of the line, which was the bar area. Their seating/waiting system was really well thought out and seemed very efficient! We were seated in under an hour, which was our original quote time. The food was delicious! We tried a lot of entrees and were absolutely stuffed by the end. We ordered the paneer tikka & vegetable samosas to start, all were delicious. The flavor on the paneer was good! The chutneys that are served with the breads and starters are amazing! For dinner we ordered the Lamb Boti Kabab- grilled lamb, which was perfectly cooked and so tasty. The Chicken Tikka flavor was great, the meat is chicken thigh, so be aware if you aren't a fan of dark meat! The Chicken Ruby was also interesting and tasty- a sweet and spicy sauce, it was a unique chicken dish! We also ordered the Gundpowder Potatoes- SO GOOD, probably my favorite thing we ordered, a variety of spices that really was a perfect combination. A few naan bread as well! To finish we had the chocolate pudding with chili ice cream. I would say the food is well priced and tasty! They have a smaller menu, but that allows them to get food out quickly- if you are looking for a lot of the classics you won't necessarily find them here. Everyone at the table was impressed with the food. Service at our table is where our review turns a little negative. Service from our specific server was a little lack luster- we had to ask someone else for water that was walking buy with a pitcher. Our server left and went on break during our meal, and so we were left with no one to get our check or clear our table. We waited a significant amount of time and didn't spot her, but finally saw her come back in with take away food for her break after 25 minutes. Thankfully we were able to steal a waiter from another area to help us get our check. Overall it was a fun experience- I wish the service at the table would have been as stellar as the service during our wait! Food was good!",4 
460,"My family was visiting London for our first time (from California), and one of the most important & most anticipated parts of the itinerary was dinner at Dishoom.The food was incredible; the manager actually recommended we ordered the cheese naan to pair with a chicken curry, and it unanimously was everybody's favorite dish. The house IPA paired well with it as well! Of course, we ordered chai at the end of dinner and it was absolutely perfect. The service was unforgettable and made the whole dining experience so special for my entire family. One of the managers ended up giving us an impromptu tour of the place, and we talked to him for a while about the way the art in the restaurant represents certain parts of Indian history / decolonization, and how that related back to our personal history!I'll definitely have to come back here every chance I get, and if I could teleport every single person I meet who knows how to appreciate Indian food here, I would. Also, be sure to make a reservation to save some time!",5 
461,"By far one of the best restaurants we tried in London. All the plates are small, perfect to share. You may need a reservation so call ahead just to make sure tables are available, specially during lunch.",5 
462,Best Indian food I've ever eaten and I've traveled the world.  Flavorful beyond belief. The lamb chops are amazing as is almost everything else. Super gluten-free friendly with a separate menu.,5 
463,"This was by far the best food I have had in London. I really was about to give up on finding something that I would sincerely crave once I got back to the states!  I don't remember the names of the dishes we ordered, but there will be a picture and the servers are super nice so they will know. The chicken tikka was so moist and flavorful. It went really well with the green and orange sauce!  The bean curry packed a lot of flavors but wasnt too overwhelming. I feel like I could eat it with naan or rice every day. The garlic naan was crispy and fragrant. Loved how well it was cooked. The other breadlike item was actually just like a tortilla so it wasnt too impressive.",5 
464,"After reading several reviews, I went to Dishoom expecting the food to taste amazing. We asked the waitress what to order and she told us her three favorite dishes. We ordered all three. The food was good but not excellent. The garlic naan was thin and burnt. We were disappointed in naan. The rest of the food tasted average, nothing too special. The mango lassi was okay, but I've had much better.",4 
465,"Wow, wow and wow. Let's kept it short, because your hands are getting super busy soon. If you can here by yourself or the first time. Chicken Ruby with CHEESE NAAN. Drinks are all really great' and if you came here for breakfast or lunch. CHAI ! House chai' just be causation you might not drink any other chai later. Tips. Come early for early lunch, or the wait is really long. Staffs are super welcoming and friendly. Plus Dishoom also donate to feed the children :) good heart and good cost'",5 
466,"Dishoom was pretty good. The cocktails and service were great. However the food was a bit hit or miss.What i ordered:Viceroys Old Fashioned - amazing, slightly sweet, with a refreshing pour of johnnie walkerLamb kebabs - dry and a bit flavorlessRomali Roti and Chicken Curry - the Roti was fairly standard and Chicken Curry was pretty goodDaal - amazing. Rich, tasty, could be a meal in and of itselfPortions are well controlled and allow you to sample a lot more. Love the ambience and plan on coming again to give it another try if I'm in the area.",4 
467,"Amazing!!! Even though we had to wait 2 hours, management was able to give us complimentary appetizers (great customer service). Coming from the U.S and as a south Asian myself, this was hands down the best Indian food I have had. Everything we received we were extremely satisfied with. Masala chai and any desserts are delicious.",5 
468,"Absolutely outstanding Indian food. We showed up for an early lunch and the place was just turning over from breakfast. We ordered a couple beers and then split the Chefs special (lamb curry), chicken tikka, veggies, and a chicken in a makhani sauce, with a side order of raita. All dishes had incredible depth of flavor and perfect amount of spice. The lamb curry was extremely tender with a great spice balance. The makhani was really tomato forward but was extremely tasty. Veggies perfectly spiced and raita was great to cool everything down. Truly some of the best Indian food we've ever had. Highly recommend a visit.",5 
469,"Amazing Indian food! Gah, never in my life have I waited in line for Indian food. Insane!But you know it's good if there's a wait... even at 4:30pm. My fiance and I waited over an hour to eat here!Like other Yelpers mentioned, after you line up in front of the door, the host takes you to the bar. I think it's kind of a dirty trick to get customers to spend money on drinks while they wait to get seated at the table. That rubbed me off the wrong way.On to the food... you must get the ruby chicken. The menu is so extensive, but we LOVED the ruby chicken, garlic naan, and one of the chicken skewers.I will definitely return with reservations next time!",5 
470,"Several friends and I were out late at night in London when they suggested indian food and being in london where indian food is supposed to be the best, of course I was down. Stupid me tho thought this was going to be a quick and dirty meal or a buffet style like they have in the states but boy was I wrong...and gladly so! We didn't end up having it that night since I soon realized how popular of a place Dishoom is but upon entering and smelling the wonderful aromas of food I decided that we absolutely HAD to come back to try this place before we left for home!We were able to get a quick seat coming to this location for lunch around 11 and we ordered basically everything that was popular on the menu and that our waiter suggested! We got the chicken ruby, pau bhaji (10/10) would recommend, garlic naan, house black daal, and lamb shanks (not a lamb fan usually, but would also def recommend. the pomegranate seeds are a unique touch). for the three of us, we honestly planned to order so much more food since it is served tapas style but our waiter warned us (so sorry I forgot his name but he was wonderful!) that it would be a lot and he was definitely right, we were SO full!The decor of this place was adorable and everything is so nicely presented. it's also priced really well for the food you get! I will DEFINITELY be back on my next trip across the pond, I already miss it SO much just typing this!!",5 
471,"varunmurali.com/blog/dis…Irani cafes have this inexplicable homely feeling about them. I absolutely love going to Kyaani with my brother back in Bombay. At Kyaani you have to get the buttery bun maska, spicy and juicy chicken farcha with the delicious gravy poured all over it, and of course the timeless salli boti.I've actually never been to an Irani cafe outside of Bombay even within India. So when I head about Dishoom a couple weeks ago I was stoked! So many people recommended it to me so there was little chance I would skip visiting this homage to Bombay's Irani cafes.I really wanted to love Dishoom, but unfortunately I felt a little let down. Though the menu was stacked with favorites of Indian cuisine, I saw few traditional Parsi dishes on it. They did have bun maska (though not for lunch) and keema pav and a few other classics.DishesThe keema pav was pretty delicious. Spicy and authentic. Complemented the hot buttered pav really well. I would have been content to stop right there given how filling and value for money that single dish was.My friend who I was eating with vouched for the okra fries. He was not wrong. They were super tangy and chatpata. Fried well and not oily at all.My friend ordered the pav bhaji. Not a fan. The bhaji was waaaaay too smooth. I strongly believe you should be able to actually tell what you're eating in a pav bhaji. You need different textures to come through. The bhaji also tasted almost too creamy. It felt more like a paneer makhani sauce than bhaji.    The chicken biryani was the biggest let down. Mild, bland, uninspired. The chicken was tender I'll give it that. Not much else going on with the dish. It was just mushy and the rice was over cooked.You can't keep me away from black dal. The menu featured it as one of their best items so we ordered it. Good, not great. Could definitely use a bit more flavor but the expected creaminess was there for sure.Oh and the rose lassis were pretty great!Would I come back?I think I would maybe once a month or so, but I would definitely stick to the smaller dishes and appetizers. Unless someone else at the table orders a main course that tastes good that is!I think the small plates are super value for money. They get you pretty full and taste great. Definitely worth checking out!",3 
472,Waiting 2 hours is not recommended.No they don't have our regular Indian Currys and all but other food was awesome.Their paneer was amazingPotato was also great.,5 
473,"FAV restaurant in London! Don't miss this Indian gem. Just be sure to get in the cue by 4-4:30pm to avoid waits of 2 hours. The food, service, atmosphere are 5 star!",5 
474,"This place was OK, but way overhyped. It is a well-decorated place, and the food was decent - but as expensive as it was (about £30-40 pp), and as long as the wait was (2 hours!!), I wouldn't do it again.The ruby chicken was the best thing we'd ordered. The paneer tikka was the runner-up for me.",3 
475,"Outstanding.Dishoom's the best Indian food I've had in the world, hands down. Some may say it's better than what they've had in India (I would agree, but I've only been to Sri Lanka).It's tough to get a table, so definitely book in advance. The staff is as friendly and helpful with choosing dishes, so do take advantage of that.Literally every dish was incredible and fresh - it really opened my eyes to what Indian food can taste like with great ingredients. I got the chicken masala, various naan, and some starters. It's pricey, yes, but you get what you pay for! Definitely worth the effort if you want to plan a great meal London - won't disappoint.",5 
476,"My favorite place in London.I had original yogurt, it was awesome.So cozy and every staff are so friendly.I'd like to come here again.",5 
477,"We were told the wait would be an hour. They served us hot chai and sherry while we waited in line. It was maybe 20 mins before we were allowed inside to sit and wait for another 15 minutes at the bar. I had the BollyBellini - would not recommend, extremely sweet. Once we were seated, our server came over to explain the menu to us a bit. Due to the combination of the noise level in the restaurant with the velocity and volume of our sever's voice, I couldn't decipher what he was saying. Our food was good. The Mahi Mahi tikka was the best. The Chicken Tikka was super spicy. The server was busy and therefore the customer service lacked. When we were finished, he cleared our plates and we advised him that we didn't want dessert. We waited 20 mins at our seats for our check. We had to track him down to ask for it. We paid cash and were waiting for our change, he took our cash and disappeared for another 10 minutes. Overall the service really killed our experience, which is why I must give this restaurant a 3/5.",3 
478,Really good Indian place for anyone visiting London.Reservation is recommended! Ordered a mango fennel lassi. It was yummy.,5 
479,"A colleague recommended this place. Obviously I did my usual thing of checking Yelp for reviews. Upon seeing that this place is the most reviewed restaurant in London, and with over 4 rating on Yelp, I was both excited but also a bit skeptical. I've been burnt by yelp reviews before.Anyway, food was fantastic. Best Indian food I've ever had. My Indian colleague who came with said it's very authentic. They definitely are not shy about using spices. In the US, you tend to get dialed down versions of Indian food.Eat here and thank me later. Anything on the menu is good. We got a few things, which I can't remember the names for. The lamb stew thing was super good.",5 
480,"Incredibly popular Indian restaurant in the heart of London, Dishoom impresses with its variety of choices and flavors, but failed to wow me.Perhaps it was a little over-hyped and, to be fair, nothing was remotely bad but I didn't feel that Dishoom was particularly better than what I've had in the US, especially considering the price was somewhat expensive.I will say that the Ruby Chicken was absolutely delicious, but the Garlic Naan was nothing special. The black house daahl basically tasted like a bean dip. The Chicken Tikka Roll was excellent and unique.The service was nice here and while the recommendations were hit and miss, Dishoom is a solid choice in London.",4 
481,"ok so this is tough.Im from NY where theres no shortage of good indian food. Now orginally my wife and i were going to head to DUM biryani house but saw the greaaat reviews and number of reviews for DISHOOM. So i ll go thru pros and consPROS- ambience is amazing. The lighting the old indians photos were superb touchThe cocktails honestly were the best part of the entire experience.  I had an excellent manhattan and my wife a colada. So no issues there. Service was great. All employees were friendly.  To the food. Best dish we had was the chicken tikka off the grill. Tender and flavorful and with the chutney selection you could make as spicey or mild as neededMattar paneer was good with excellent flavors and one of there signature dishes the black dhal was on point i must say.Cons- spicy lamb chops, first werent spicy and second they were overcooked. Cmon man there should be some red. We also got the signature prawn moilee in a yellow curry and it was just OK man.  I mean the shrimp was a bit over cooked. I wouldnt even say they were prawns. It wasnt bland but i did have high expectations. My wife ordered some coleslaw and felt the yogurt in their mightve been old. To summarize id say its a good place overall but if your expecting curries like some tikka masala vindaloo or saag .. yea not here. I mean im torn, i think people will enjoy the overall experience in general but really if youve been to other indian restuarants around the world this isnt even top 5 food wise. Go enjoy and have drinks and other small plates and judge for urself",3 
482,"The BEST Indian food I've ever had!!! My boyfriend is Pakistani and loves Indian food and agrees with that statement also!! So good we went back twice in less than 24 hours. Small plates: We had the okra fries, lamb samosas, and keema pau- all SO amazing. The keema pau is Iranian and was soooo delicious- the lamb is flavorful and a little oily, which makes it go perfectly with the homemade bun that goes with it (which is toasted to perfection!). Mains: between the two days we tried the chicken ruby (twice!!) which is basically their version of butter chicken. It is honestly the best butter chicken I've ever had. We also had the chicken berry biryani which was delicious- the berries gave it a nice and different flavor. We also had the house black daal which was delicious, and I'm a huge daal lover. My bf also had the dishoom chicken tikka roll was very tasty also. And of course we had garlic naan with it all!Drinks: my bf tried the dishoom pale ale and thought it was really good! I also had the bollybellini which was very tasty, but definitely a sweet cocktail. I also had the baileys chai which was so delicious, perfect amounts of both and an amazing cream on top. Dessert: we had the dishoom chocolate pudding- so good!! It's more of a molten chocolate flourless cake, less like a traditional American pudding. It comes with a spicy chili ice cream which is so unique. Overall very delicious",5 
483,This restaurant was excellent! Beautiful location. Friendly servers. They served us right away and was patient with us as we decided on what to order.,5 
484,We got high recommendations for this place on Google. And after checking it out online and here on Yelp I decided to get o the safe side and get reservations for our group of four. The Indian food was amazing and we all had a great time. The setting and atmosphere was very cook too.Advice: make sure to get reservations. I saw people waiting in the line and pitied them.,5 
485,Some friends of our booked a table of 9 and needed 3-4 weeks in advance and could only get a 4:45pm time slot. But the food was well worth it. We ended up ordering almost everything on the menu of which took the left-overs home and finished the rest the following day. There was a 1-2 hrs waiting line when we finished dinner around 6:30pm,5 
486,"Elite. Everything was amazing and to perfection. We did have to wait like an hour to get in but even from the moment we went inside to wait at the bar, we were taken care of and that whole experience with the atmosphere and the vibe was just perfect. the waiter was awesome and the food was just gorgeous. I don't think I've ever been into a place with everything including atmosphere, people and the food being that good, so highly highly recommend it was amazing definitely recommend!!!!",5 
487,"Upon entering we were greeted at the small desk by the door. We didn't have any reservations (at 11:30am) bit luckily there were a few tables open; it was getting busy already. We ordered a couple of drinks and food. Everything was great tasting, and spicy. I wish I could have eaten more. The restaurant itself is nice and clean, and the staff friendly. It is probably a little ""touristy"", but it is still a good place to eat. We walked past at dinner time and the line was out the door",5 
488,"I can not believe what delicious food we had!  I'll be back every day this week despite the hour wait outside in the rain.  It's that good.  Ruby Chicken, Black Daal, Raita, cheese naan, and some sort of potatoes with ""an addictive chemical that makes me crave it fortnightly!""  Do not miss while in London!! But don't wait on queue in front of me .  They brought us deliciously warm chai tea while we waited outside - and they were attentive to us on queue by keeping us apprised of our personal wait time.",5 
489,"I'm so glad I went to Dishoom. The ambience, food, service everything about this place is wonderful. Be ready for long lines. I waited an hour and half to be seated but while you wait they give you yummy indian tea (chai) and mint tea. Once we got inside I was so impressed with the ambience it's completely different from what you would expect from an indian restaurant. I ordered the famous house lentils, naan, lamb boti, chicken ruby, and rose/cardamom lassi. Everything was good. When I go again I don't think I'll get the lamb boti. I thought it was okay. But everything else was spot on. If you love lassi you have to try the rose and cardamom lassi, you won't be disappointed.",5 
490,Most incredible service of all time. So accommodating to food allergies. Amazing food! Absolutely delicious.,5 
491,A friend recommended Dishoom and I'm so glad my mother and I decided to come. Our waiter was very nice and attentive. It was a hot day and there was a short wait outside of the restaurant. They gave us complimentary drinks. Not sure what it was but tasted like a limeade. We were seated downstairs and we ordered vegetable samosas as an appetizer. I ordered mattar paneer and garlic naan and my mom ordered macchi tikka and cheese naan. Everything was soooo good and good portion sizes. The cheese naan was great! For dessert we shared a mango kulfi. It was so refreshing! Will be back when I'm back in the UK.,5 
492,"I have to say--I didn't think the 45-minute wait on a Monday night would be worth it, but happily, I was wrong.  The service once you get inside Dishoom is top-notch and the Indian food is above average (had the black daal, the Chicken Ruby, the Roomali Roti and a cheese naan), but I'm not sure it was necessarily the greatest Indian I've ever had...maybe, in part, because I've been to India twice and loved the food on those trips.But then?  I had the lamb samosas for dessert.  Sweet Jesus, these were amazing.  The samosas canopy shells were fantastic, the minced lamb inside was tasty, and the three spices left on my table were all excellent.If I could make reservations here and know my seating time, I would have eaten here a couple more times to try other items on the menu.  As it was, very strong, but you can tell there are some very specific treasures on this menu!",4 
493,"Impressive flavors, impressive ambiance and seriously knowledgeable and friendly staff. Can't wait to go back to London, just to visit this place again.",5 
494,"While the presentation and ambience were really nice and the chai during the wait was a nice touch the food was mediocre. The special pav Bhaji was volcanic with no flavor. The chefs special black dal was red, with an overpowering tomato base. Big let down considering the build up and the hour long wait...",1 
495,"We waited 51 minutes, but was quoted 1 hour 10 minutes. Loved the gimlet! Refreshing drink. The cheese toast, fried Ochoa, vegstable samosas, and biriyani were very good. Nice ambience. Great place for a date!",5 
496,"Had a fantastic experience at Dishoom Covent Garden. We were a family of 10 and were seated right on time at a booth that just about fit all of us. The set menu for 10 had a lot of variety and our server went above and beyond to accommodate us, particularly since we had a specific food allergy that we hadn't noted beforehand, but somewhat surprisingly ended up being a staple ingredient in many dishes. Our server, Thomas, went back to the kitchen to get a full breakdown of what did and did not have that ingredient on the entire menu and the restaurant was willing to swap some of the small plates for us based on this assessment. Thomas also came back to explain which of the set menu dishes would be free of the allergen. We really appreciate his efforts and positive attitude.All of the food was delicious and portioned nicely. The appetizers on the set menu were a little spicy for my table but the entrees had a lot fewer spicy dishes. My personal favourite is the chicken tikka masala! Our table also really enjoyed the jackfruit biryani. The rice pudding for dessert was also really good. Definitely make a reservation! Set menu for tables of 10 or over.",5 
497,"I tried to go for Dishoom for dinner one night at about 8pm.  Forget it.  Liine out the door and waiting list was 1 hr.  Did I mention this was a Tuesday night.   Needless to say I did not give up, and came back on Thursday for a late lunch.    It was definitely worth it.  I had the fried okra which were very flavorful, a little to much spice for me but very nice.   I then tried the bbq prawns which were delightful, cooked on the tandoor, with the right level of spice and flavor, worth trying.   Then I went to the roomali roti with the house special chicken ruby.  This dish was fantastic.   A slight twist on butter chicken it had wonderful taste and was excellent.   This is definitely a place to go to when in trafalgar square.  The service is super fast, though the staff are clearly not experts in Indian food.",5 
498,"The lamp chops are awesome. It's tender, a bit charred at the right places, and sprinkled with pomegranate. We also ordered their signature dish Black Daal, which is curry with lentils, and Chicken Ruby along with some naan and rice. It's worth the half an hour wait and we hope to go again!",5 
499,Delicious mattar paneer and garlic naan. So good on a cold day! Chocolate chai is a must try if you visit.,5
