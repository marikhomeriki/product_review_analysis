       "{\"I have been with this bank since the MIdland days and have to say in recent years the service is incredibly poor. Everything is pushed towards the mobile app and if you want to actually speak to a person or use any other means of accessing your money, it is made increasingly difficult. If you raise your concerns with any member of staff you are just pushed to the ever long call queue to fix things you never even caused in the first place.I've given too many opportunities for HSBC to prove me wrong and unfortunately now I feel it is time to move all accounts elsewhere.\": 1,\n",

She has spent over a period of 3 calls to the HSBC over 3 hours waiting for an Agent to speak to her and deal with the request. She passed the security voice check and her request was recognised so why did she need to speak to an agent when this could have been dealt with by the automated HSBC system. My mother now intends to change to a more helpful bank.': 1,\n",

Combine that with a sub-par digital product, it begs the question what is the point of HSBC as a retail bank? Clearly they don't care about product and customers.
