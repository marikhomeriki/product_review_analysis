      "Example 0: We are Californians in London for the first time . We stopped here and we ' re helped and served by the cutest women . We weren ' t sure what to order so they filled us in on the popular choices . They were spot on and we loved the champ potatoes and 2 sausages . Then had dessert , the sticky toffee and custard sauce was just what the doctor ordered . We added a scoop of ice cream but wished we hadn ' t it was perfect without . It was the perfect filling and warming <meal:Positive Confidence:0.9998016953468323> for a cool London day . Sorry no pics we were halfway through when I thought about it .\n",

      "Example 0: Don ' t trust the listed hours ! Mother Mash closes when it wants to , regardless of any times posted online . We were staying near Buckingham Palace , and decided to walk to the nearest Mother Mash , a twenty - five minute walk . We didn ' t think anything of it , considering on their website it says that they close at 10 PM . We arrived around 8 : 00 PM . We walked in and a man with his hand outstretched comes toward us , and we start to back out as he comes closer . He all but pushes us out the door stating , \" We ' re closed , bruv ! \" We were shocked . Imagine walking all that way for something specific , to be turned away so rudely . We had had a fine experience at another location and had been looking forward to having Mother Mash as our last meal in the city . We ended up having Chinese food . Not ideal . What a shame .\n",

      "Example 0: Tucked away in Soho along a street of other eateries , Mother Mash was open on a rainy Sunday evening . I always want to try the local dishes while I ' m traveling so this was a perfect opportunity to try some bangers and mash ( a traditional British dish , consisting of sausages served with mashed potatoes ) before we headed back home . Surprisingly , it was quiet and we were able to be seated right away . The space is small , but has a handful of seats inside and outside . The toilet , along with the kitchen is downstairs . Menu is straightforward . You pick your mash , your sausage , and type of gravy . I went with the cheesy mash , Lincolnshire sausage , and traditional gravy . It wasn ' t before long that our dishes came out . The mashed potatoes were a bit thick and gummy - and honestly I kind of like them that way . However , it ' s a sign that the potatoes have been overworked and too much starch was released . Not sure if that ' s how it ' s normally served , BUT again , I like them that way . The sausage was nice and flavorful and paired nicely with my gravy . They did mix up my gravy with my husband ' s though , but that worked out in my favor , lol . Go for the caramelized onion gravy as the traditional gravy didn ' t have as much flavor . For dessert I ordered the sticky toffee pudding for takeaway and shared it with my family back home . It was delish , but what made it even more tasty was adding a scoop of caramel ice cream . Yum ! Overall , good spot to try some traditional British dishes if you ' re nearby .\n",

      "Example 0: First meal in London and knew I had to try bangers and <mash:Positive Confidence:0.9881625771522522> so we made a stop by here while exploring Soho ! Basically you can choose your type of mash , sausage ( or pie ) and gravy . I had the champ mash which came with green onions , mother plucker sausage which was flavoured with sundried tomatoes , all topped with a farmer ' s sauce ( red wine sauce with bacon ) . The mash was so creamy but the green onions cut the heaviness . The sausage reminded me a bit of the Chinese sausage in hot rice bowls . The best part though was the gravy . . didn ' t leave a drop of it on my plate . Such a delicious comforting <food:Positive Confidence:0.9983142614364624> !

You choose a type of mashed potato you want , either a sausage or pie and a gravy to put on top . We picked the sausage option and it comes with 2 - we got to try two different flavors plus ordered two extra sausages to try out the other flavors . One plate was enough for two people and we left satisfied . All sausages we tried were great ! They also give you extra gravy if you need more - free of charge . It ' s great comfort food that won ' t leave your pockets empty . What we enjoyed in this place was the great customer service as well . The woman who served us was so nice and friendly , and also attentive . That is always so appreciated ! This place hit the spot - added plus was the great service !
