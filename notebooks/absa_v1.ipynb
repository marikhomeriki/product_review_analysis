I had the <pancakes:Positive Confidence:0.9858995079994202> and bacon naan for breakfast . Both were delicious . Despite the toffee sauce , the pancakes weren ' t overly sweet . The bacon naan has a nice tomato <jam:Positive Confidence:0.5920423865318298> to help balance the bacon . Apparently the <chai:Positive Confidence:0.7308474779129028> is bottomless and I missed the memo l until we were cashing out . Lesson learned .

      "Example 0: Have been wanting to go to Dishoom for years and I was glad it conveniently fit into my morning schedule . I passed it several times in the days before in the afternoons and the line gets insanely long for dinner time . I walked in and got seated with ease . The store itself is absolutely stunning . The area is huge . Even going downstairs to use the bathroom is like a different experience . I came around 9am during their breakfast menu , which I didn ' t know about . Guess I have to come back during later meals to try their other items . I got the keema per eedu . It was super flavorful and rich . Maybe I got too excited and scarfed it down too fast . It put me in a huge food coma . The liver , egg , and savory flavors felt heavy . It was an explosion in your mouth . I washed this down with chai and a cappuccino . The service was prompt . The store was scattered with some people out for leisure and business meals . There was always a consistent amount of people filling the shop throughout my meal . Gotta come back to try their regular menu - - likely when I have more time in London !\n",

      "Example 0: 4 . 5 / 5 stars As someone who isn ' t well versed in Indian food , the menu can be overwhelming . Our waiter was kind enough to explain that the dishes were meant to be shared , and he made recommendations for what dishes would be good . We got a few small plates : the Pau Bhaji ( Mashed vegetables with buns ) and the lamb samosa . Both of these were excellent . The lamb samosa was so crispy , hot , and flavorful . The Pau Bhaji was new for me . The bun was so fluffy and buttery and was perfect with the mashed vegetables . It just tasted like a herb / spice sauce . For our main entrees , we got the chicken berry biryani ( chicken and rice dish ) and the mutton pepper fry ( curry dish ) and added the raita ( yogurt sauce ) . The chicken biryani was quite good , and the chicken was pretty tender . The raita was supposed to be used with the biryani , but it kinda made the dish too cold for my liking . The mutton pepper fry was tender and flavorful ! It was spicy , but I was surprisingly able to tolerate it . We ordered garlic naan , which was perfect for scooping all the sauce . It didn ' t have a strong garlic flavor , and it wasn ' t piping hot . We also ordered the chili broccoli salad , which was divine ! The combination of pistachios , seeds , and dates made the broccoli so tasty ! Overall , I enjoyed our meal here and loved trying new foods ! We came around 5 : 15 pm and didn ' t need to wait for a table , but when we left the restaurant , there was a huge line , so definitely try to go during off peak hours .\n",

      "Example 0: Food 5 / 5Ambiance 5 / 5Service 5 / 5You ' ll likely have to wait anywhere from 30 minutes to an hour for a table depending on the timing and your group size , but it ' s well worth it . They will sometimes pass out drinks to those waiting in line which is a nice touch . The food is stellar , though a bit different from your typical Indian restaurant in that it ' s more of a small plates style . Since portions are smaller , they recommend at least 2 - 3 plates per person here . My favorite was the Dishoom House Chaat , a dish that was recommended by our waiter . Note that unlike other Indian restaurants , they don ' t ask you for a preferred spice level on their dishes , so if you ' re particularly sensitive to spice , ask your waiter for specific recommendations . Ambiance is lively and there are neat booths downstairs where you can control the music level and ( if I remember correctly ) the fan as well - something I haven ' t seen at another restaurant . Bathrooms are also quite nice and clean - something that is always hugely appreciated in a big city like London . I will be making this a regular spot for anytime I ' m in London !\n",

Its Indian cuisines and its has a wide array of options . I feel like this is perfect for people that might be intimidated by Indian food and want to try it for the first time . Theres so much great choices for various diets : vegetarians , vegans , carnivores , etc . My partner is a vegan and she was pleased with all the options . I went with the Ruby Chicken which is essentially a tika masala chicken . Run don ' t walk to get it . Very delicious and the sauce with some basmati rice is outstanding .

      "Example 0: Came here for an early lunch when passing through the UK a while back and wow . . . the best indian food I have eaten out at a restaurant ! ! I generally don ' t eat indian food out because my parents are amazing cooks and we can enjoy good food from the comfort of our home most times . Before I came to the UK , numerous people raved about Dishoom telling me it was a must go ! We had a quick stopover in the UK and made it a priority to come here ! One thing to note is that they have breakfast hours where they serve a completely different menu from the regular lunch / dinner food . We had showed up early and they were still serving brunch . Call and check this in advance because we ended up waiting over an hour in the restaurant to get lunch food ! Nonetheless , the wait was worth it ! The ambiance of this spot it really pleasant and unique . We were treated so wonderfully by the staff and service was quite quick once lunch opened . We ordered a few different entrees - - chili chicken , chicken , daal , chicken tikka , and naan . We also got a mango lassi and rice on the side . The food was amazing ! Flavors were solid , and meat was tender . I highly recommend all the dishes we ordered because I would 100 % order them all again .\n",

At noon we walked in and were taken downstairs to their enormous seating area . That wasn ' t the case when my friend and I walked back from the theater ( there was a line that wrapped around the building for the dinner rush - 6pm ish ) If I were to describe Dishoom it ' s like a very trendy upscale Indian Restaurant that sort of gives me Cheesecake Factory feels ( in terms of it ' s grandness and over the top space and atmosphere ) . After reviewing the extensive menu we decided on the following to share . Meal Pau Bhahi £5 . 90 : Bowl of Mashed Vegetables with Hot Butter , homemade buns - I loved this as a starter ! The buns were luxurious and buttery and a great way to pile on the veggie spread . Chicken Ruby £13 . 50 : Tastes like Chicken Tikki Marsala - Solid and I would order this again . Garlic Naan £3 . 90 : It was okay , not as light and fluffy as I ' ve had at other places , but I still used it to dip into the various curriesTandoori Roti £3 . 50 : Didn ' t care for it . I ' d passBlack Daal £7 . 50 : I think this is a very hearty lentil curry . It ' s quite filling but among the three curry dishes this was my least favorite - not that it was bad , but the others were more of my taste . I think if I were to do this again I ' d take this out of my order . They charge an automatic 12 . 50 service charge ( tip ) SummaryOverall , it ' s a very nice UK chain restaurant to visit . It ' s comfortable , well lit , accessible and classy .\n"

      "Example 0: WOW ! ! ! If it is your final night in London , do not leave without dining at Dishoom . * Spicy Lamb Chops * Chicken Ruby * Raita * Kachumber * Garlic Naan * Peacock CiderEvery single item we ordered was outstanding ! ! ! ! Everything . The cider included . The lamb chops stole the show . Thick , succulent , herb - spiced . I have never had lamb chops like this before . Even our waiter said these were his top 3 chops he has ever had . I would agree . You will want to eat all of the meat to the bone . The Chicken Ruby , their name for \" curry \" has tender , succulent chunks of chicken that has been marinated for 24 + hours in a nutty , butter sauce . There are no nuts ( my friend is allergic ) but the flavor is hearty and earthy . So good ! Raita could have been a little thicker but the flavor made up for that . Kachumber reminded me of a greek salad but with cilantro ( coriander ) and green chili peppers . The lime brings a balances the dish and cuts the spice from the chili pepper nicely . While I have had better garlic Naan , it was not a disappointment . I washed everything down with a glass of Peacock Cider and hope to be able to find it back in the states . Beautiful interior decor that is modern , and stylish without being flashy . Perfect for a date or a night out with friends . On my next visit to London I will absolutely return to Dishoom .\n",

      "Example 0: We got to Soho and there was a long wait to get in this restaurant . I was so excited because I wanted to know if the hype of it all was represented in the food . When we went in I smelled all the aroma of something great as far as Indian food . Everyone seem to be having such a great time and the Decor was just very eclectic and homey . I will say everyone who worked there was super nice and the service was great . However , I did not like the food . I looked around and there was another couple at the other table across from us and it didn ' t appear that they liked the food either . We ordered the samosas and they were tiny and crunchy and not like a regular Samosa at all . Didn ' t like these and wouldn ' t order these again . I also ordered the butter chicken and I was not a fan of the butter chicken , it had another name on the menu but basically this is what it was . . . The chicken was fatty and had some skin on it and the sauce was gritty almost pasty . My friend got the lamb chops and they were over cooked . There was an OK flavor there but when you over cook lamb chops that is kind of a terrible thing . I got a drink and the drink was OK but nothing to write home about . The garlic naan was gross . It didn ' t have a garlic flavor at all . I think the atmosphere here was far better than the food . My experience at another Indian restaurant here was far better than Dishoom .\n"

      "Example 0: After having owned the cookbook from Dishoom for a while , I was really excited to try the dishes straight from the origin . I made a reservation for one during lunch hours on a long layover I had in London . A reservation is definitely recommended , by the time I was leaving , there was a line outside . As soon as I walked into the restaurant , I was taken by the gorgeous interiors . You can tell that the decor was carefully picked out and the detailing of every element of the restaurant was beautiful . It ' s a lovely ambiance to have a meal in . When I sat down , they handed me this cute paper menu that looked like a newspaper . Since I was dining alone , I asked the waitress for her best recommendations . She gave me several options from the small plates , entrees , and breads / rices . I started with the house chai . Then I chose a small plate - - the okra fries , an entree - - the lamb chops , and a garlic naan to go with it . The chai came out first and that was so delicious ; I had 3 glasses ( btw , they refill the chai for free ! ) . Then came the okra fries and wow . That was one of the best preparations of okra I ' ve ever tasted . Then my lamb chops and garlic naan came , and if you come here , you HAVE to try the lamb chops . They were cooked to perfection and extremely delicious . The garlic naan I probably could have done without with this dish , it was a bit thin and less fluffy than I was expecting . Overall , I absolutely loved this restaurant . It is a place not to be missed . I look forward to coming back in the future to try more of their dishes .\n",

      "Example 0: When I was in London a month prior , I had been unable to get a reservation at Dishoom and the line to get in was down the block . I made a point to make a reservation for my return trip , and even a few weeks out could only get a very late lunch or very early dinner reservation . This probably is somewhere it ' s better to come with a group so that you can try different things , but as a solo traveler I had the : CHEF ' S COVENT GARDEN SPECIAL ( TILA - FOI ' S VERY BEST MASALA FISH ) Aunty - ji ' s recipe , refined over decades with love . Two fillets of sea bream marinated in Tila - foi ' s masala with ginger - garlic , black pepper , lime juice , carrom seeds and red chilli . Griddled within a banana leaf and served to share . Eat with companionable Coconut Chaas . It says served to share but I definitely ate the whole thing myself . It was very flavorful and to the disappointment of the server , I did not eat it with the Coconut Chaas , but rather , plain . I found that there were so many spices and flavors in the fish that I did not want to drown it in a yogurt / sauce . I would love to try some of their more \" traditional \" dishes ( that you would find on the menu at other Indian restaurants ) so that I could do a comparison , but at the same time , why get something that you can get anywhere . I suppose this is why you need to come with a group ( if you can get a reservation ! ) . All in all I had a great experience here but am not sure that I ' d wait in a long line ( very good , but not amazing ) .\n",

      "Example 0: One of the best and most consistently great restaurants in London . This is one of my regular go - to ' s and somewhere I like take people who are coming from out of town . There are multiple locations each with a slightly different ambiance but the food is always good at each of them . My typical order includes the following : Prawn koliwada : This is a great starter that comes in a cute bowl filled with succulent prawns that come with some heat . They are slightly crispy on the outside , juicy on the inside . They pair well with any of the sauces and chutneys they bring to your table . I like to mix the spicy and mild together ( orange / red and green sauces ) Garlic cheese naan : I mean , is there a better combination ? The naan has a great cheese pull and is filled with chilli ' s for a perfect light kick . Chicken tikka : no , this isn ' t chicken tikka masala . This is grilled chicken thighs with some lovely seasoning and comes with a coriander ( cilantro ) and red onion garnish . Simple but executed well 24 hour daal : do yourself a favour and order this . These lentils have been stewing away for 24 hours and are a great component with your meal . Creamy texture and flavourful , quite comforting . Chilli chicken : my second favorite small dish . This chicken packs quite some spice but it ' s a can ' t miss dish . The chicken is crunchy and gently coated with a chilli sauce that isn ' t overbearing in terms off the amount . So , you want to dine here ? They only take reservations for larger groups which means you have to queue ( wait in line ) but it ' s absolutely worth it . You can put your name in and grab a nice drink from the bar but do expect at least an hour wait so you can factor that in to when you arrive . Happy eating !\n",

      "Example 0: Dishoom is a London staple and one of the most must - try restaurants in the city . Come order delicious Bombay cuisine off the large , newspaper - styled menu while enjoying a casual , Indian summer breeze kind of vibe . My favorites are the house black daal ( rich and complex flavors ! ) , the chicken ruby , and the mutton pepper fry . The prawn koliwada also makes a nice appetizer , and the roti is great for dipping and soaking up various saucy dishes . If you come before noon , you can enjoy their fabulous breakfast instead . The Big Bombay has everything savory you could want , including scrumptious akuri ( like spicy scrambled eggs ) and masala beans . Meanwhile , if you want something sweet , go for the uttapam stack : pancake - like , topped with creamy - yet - fluffy , sweet - yet - slightly - tangy whipped yogurt and berries . Enjoy it all with the bottomless house chai . There are multiple locations , but this one in Covent Garden is my favorite for being casual yet comfortable and very spacious . There ' s often a line , but it moves quickly ( e . g . , less than 30 minutes - - and they ' ll bring complementary chai and mint tea while you wait ! ) . Overall an excellent choice for tourists or locals alike !\n"

      "Example 0: Been wanting to try out Dishoom for the longest time as it is the most reviewed place in London , insane considering there are other world - famous landmarks like the Big Ben and the British Museum . Made a reservation online and was seated promptly in a cute dome - shaped booth . - Chicken Ruby - This is essentially butter chicken and I really enjoyed the flavor which had hints of ginger in it . The chicken was also very tender and flavorful . My one complaint though is that the dish didn ' t come with naan or rice and this is given that you know , so you do have to order an extra side in order for the main dish to not be so salty . - Garlic Naan - Good relief from the saltiness of the chicken ruby . To be honest , you couldn ' t really taste the garlic bit of it , so I wouldn ' t say you have to order the garlic flavored naan . Overall , pretty solid Indian place . Not sure if it lives up to the hype of being the most reviewed place in London but the food was all - around very good . My other only complaint is that it was my friend ' s birthday and they gave us a dessert to celebrate with a candle . The dessert was good but it was not free which is what it usually is in America , so that was a bit disappointing but now I know .\n",

The shrimp was a fun dish to try out as well - crispy and spicy . For the drinks , I tried ( and loved ) the 1948 sour . My husband had the India gimlet , which he enjoyed as well .

I then finally went online to make a reservation , and the only available reservations were around 4 : 30PM / 5PM , which is usually too early for me except for the day I went ! I made a reservation for 5 : 15PM and I think I got there a bit early , probably around 5PM . I was seated immediately and there was no line yet , but while I was there , the line outside grew and grew . So happy I made a reservation ! Anyway , the food . I was given a quick rundown of the menu and recommendations without asking for them , and I ended up getting : - mango & fennel lassi : I ' ve had mango lassis before but never with fennel seeds ( although to be honest , I don ' t think the fennel seeds added anything ) . - pau bhaji which is mashed vegetables with bread : A bit light on the flavor for the vegetables but the bread was perfectly toasted , soft inside and crunchy outside . - tila foi which is fish wrapped in a banana leaf : The fish was a tad spicy but super flavorful , and I enjoyed the pink yogurt that came on the side with it . - garlic naan : The naan was a bit flat for my taste , not chewy , and very oily - that was probably my least favorite item from everything I ordered . - basmati kheer : This almost looked like a creme brulee with a caramelized , burnt top , and underneath it was rice pudding . Not too sweet which I appreciated , and the blueberry compote on top was delicious , wish there was more of it . Everything was super flavorful and unique ! I really enjoyed the food here . Service was quite good too although I had to ask for utensils ; my server looked confused that I didn ' t have any . Food was pretty pricey although I did order a lot , came out to be around 45 GBP . Would highly recommend , but definitely make a reservation ! There ' s also pretty good wifi here .\n",

The <food:Positive Confidence:0.9998582601547241> is very good but I wouldn ' t say it was the \" best Indian ever \" like some of the reviews here describe - for example the house Chaat came with soggy <potatoes:Negative Confidence:0.9968882203102112> and the <lamb chops:Negative Confidence:0.9635770320892334> could have used more seasoning .

      "Example 0: Very central location in Covent Garden , quick walk away from Leicester Square . Most reviews are from Americans visiting London and not from locals . Line out the door and informed of 60 min wait , nice touch to serve chai outside while waiting . It was a 30 min wait outside and another 15 min at the bar . I don ' t really like this trick of having the patrons seated at the bar while the table is being made ready for you . Seems like a strategy to put the guest on the spot to order a drink . The non - alcohol pineapple cream drink was very refreshing , frothy and icy , coconut flakes served on top . Seated downstairs , although would have preferred upstairs , but with these wait times what can you do , and it would be long waits at most good places in the area . Open style kitchen where you can see the chefs flaming things up on the grill and beating up the naan dough . Prices are cheap looking , but portion sizes slightly smaller . Not so many sauce dishes . I had the dry style chicken tikka . No yoghurt , instead marinated in vinegar . It was very good quality chicken . Chicken Berry biryani also good , cooked properly and not just mixed chicken and rice . No complaints about the naan . Very difficult to get a reservation unless far in advance .\n",

      "Example 0: The first Indian <food:Positive Confidence:0.9903469681739807> I ever had was in London . The place was called Top Curry Centre . Sadly the place was shuttered just this past year due to the pandemic . I asked the hotel concierge who recommended Dishoom and now I know why . It ' s good I came for <lunch:Positive Confidence:0.9628230333328247> because the lines around the block for dinner were outrageous . For lunch I was <seated:Positive Confidence:0.8618937134742737> promptly to the lower level near the open kitchen . The place was bustling with diners and understandably so . This place was fantastic ! The food here had depths of <flavor:Positive Confidence:0.9930471777915955> you won ' t get at any Devon avenue place in Chicago which makes me wonder what happened to the Indian food in America which just got so bland . Anyway I digress , check out the pics and they will speak for themselves . When in London , this is a must go !\n",

      "Example 0: Okay , i didn ' t have a reservation . Therefore , we went early hoping to get a table . The hostess was very friendly and sat us very quickly . The menu is extensive and can be a bit overwhelming . We decided to ask the food server for recommendations . We ended up ordering 4 dishes with some garlic naan . Here are our favorites in order Chicken Ruby - let ' s just say , we wanted to lick the bowl it came in . House Black Daal - this dish complimented the chicken ruby . I think it would compliment any dish really well . Okra fries - the seasoning they put on these lovely treats is addicting Raita - glad we ordered this . It definitely helped cool down the spice level of the sheekh kabab . Sheekh kabab - we probably could have done without this dish . It was our least favorite . I like spicy and this was too spicy . We didn ' t finish this dish . Bastmati Rice - we initially forgot to order rice . Luckily , we remembered before the food arrived . We used the rice to soak up the ruby sauce and daal , so good . Garlic Naan - it was good The okra , chicken and daal was enough considering . we ordered rice and naan . I would definitely go back for the above . I would pass on the kabab and raita\n"

We made sure to make a reservation , as we ' d read how crowded it can get . There was a line from opening time and they were consistently seating tables . The ambiance and atmosphere is so beautiful and peaceful and a great complement to the food . We both had the house chai ( which I would have taken a jug of with me , if I could ) . It is warm with a bit of spice and just makes you feel calm and happy . It ' s the perfect morning drink . It ' s also bottomless until 5 pm so they will continue to give you refills ( and the price was only 3 . 50 GBP - - a steal ! ) . I had the double bacon naan roll and my husband had the Wrestler ' s naan roll and we also got the uttapam pancakes to share . This was a lot of food for us in the morning so we couldn ' t finish the pancakes but I still have dreams about how amazing the naan rolls were . The bacon is amazing and so flavorful , the naan is very fresh and then it ' s complemented with a balance of cilantro as a garnish , cream cheese spread on the naan , and a tomato - chili jam which is not too spicy and out of this world . It was so good we went to Dishoom Kings Cross two days later to get the same breakfast and buy their house chai to bring home ! ! !

      "Example 0: I ' ve wanted to try out Dishoom in Covent Garden for a long time now , as one of the most - reviewed businesses on Yelp in London , this is also the original Dishoom which opened back in 2010 . It re - opened in 2021 after a refurbishment and the interior looks really good . The restaurant has a nice feel to it , it feels very open and welcoming and matches other Dishoom locations I ' ve visited , I do prefer the interior of their Kings Cross location , however , but this one certainly isn ' t too bad either . I did find the chairs to be very uncomfortable , being placed on garden chairs - I don ' t know how they lasted the refurb . I didn ' t find service to be as good as other stores , no one checked up on me during my meal to ask if everything was okay , this was frustrating especially given the fact they weren ' t overly busy , and my table was right next to where a couple of staff members were standing - they still put a service charge onto the bill at the end too , adding insult to injury ! The food , however , was excellent , I really enjoyed my Chicken Ruby , which has a generous portion of chicken , it was well - spiced and well seasoned , the basmati rice accompanied this really well , and so did the gunpowder potatoes , this delivered possibly the best food I ' ve had during my most recent trip to London . The way the restaurant is designed , it ' s meant for sharing , this isn ' t a place you can come on your own for lunch , instead , come with a friend , or perhaps a more romantic setting , order multiple dishes and sides and share , the portion of rice and potatoes , for example , was huge and this would certainly be enough for 2 - 3 people to have a good portion and leave with a full stomach . PRO TIP : Make a reservation , you can make a reservation for most of the day other than \" evening meal times \" , the queues outside can get really long ( they have umbrellas waiting ) , so to avoid being disappointed , it is well worth booking in advance via their online website . 4 * - Excellent food , a nice interior , but lacklustre service means I will probably be heading to the Kings Cross branch in future .\n"

Both were hot crispy and soft and needed to soak up the sauces . We also ordered the house black DA a L which was really interesting and we stopped up all of it with the naan . And even though we were full we had to order dessert chocolate pudding with chili ice cream and basmati Kheer . The chocolate pudding is the same as a gooey chocolate lava cake and the other desert tasted like a cross between rice pudding and crème brûlée . Both highly recommend we left full but happy .

We orderedHouse bhel - it was certainly innovative and tasted ok . Bhel - I was given the dry mix and the 3 separate sauces - garlic , tamarind and mint . I did not get the bhel experience : sauces tasted fine separately thoughPaneer tikka was at the most mediocre ! Matar paneer - As the only vegetarian curry option , I want this to be spectacular - this was anything but that ! The spices left a bitter aftertaste ! ! ! House black dal - there was less dal and a similar spice gravy like there is in matar paneer . It had extreme amount of butter - did not taste good or authentic ! Jackfruit biryani - overcooked mushy rice which tasted sour and nothing like biryani ! Pros - the only 2 reasons for 2 stars are : Nans were goodPaneer was freshI do hope that Dhishum does something to cater vegetarian population too .

      "Example 0: Kicking off our first international trip with the kids , we landed in London at some point in the afternoon , took the Underground to Covent Gardens , dropped off all our stuff at our apartment , and headed off to explore . The line for Dishoom caught our attention so I started waiting for a table , half dazed from the long flight but also trying to read our travel guidebook , while my wife and kids wandered off to look around . After about an hour we were seated and had one of our favorite meals of the trip . The kids still talk about the chicken ruby , which has set the standard for any sort of Indian chicken dish that they eat . The chicken is tender , and the flavorful sauce is a brilliant red color ( yelp . com / user _ local _ phot … ) , which I might have missed if I hadn ' t obnoxiously used my camera flash to light it up ( sorry everyone else who was sitting downstairs ) . We also got the chicken biryani and green vegetables , as well as some potatoes . Given that we were celebrating our first night in London , we let the kids order some fancy drinks . The restaurant has a very trendy and lively atmosphere . We sat downstairs where it was a little dark and packed with people . The wait staff were nice , even when asking me to please stop taking photos of my food with the flash . A very memorable meal for us and well worth the wait .\n",

So hopefully this should dispel any doubts as to whether Dishoom is worth the wait - - because it absolutely is . The food blew my mind and I easily had one of the greatest meals of my life . If you are in London you seriously need to make a point of going to one of the Dishoom locations . ( Note : This location is currently closed until summer 2020 . ) Things to get ( in order of necessity ) : Chicken Ruby - maybe my favorite thing I ' ve ever eaten . I ate every last drop of it with my garlic naan . Do not come here without ordering this . Pau Bhaji - I ' m not exactly sure what is in this other than potatoes and perfect spices but it is wonderful . The warm buttery buns it comes with go perfectly with it . This is another must order . Chocolate pudding with spiced ice cream - You ' ll probably be so full by the time you hit dessert that you will want to pass on it . Don ' t do that . This is unreal . The chocolate is so rich and flavorful and it tastes absolutely perfect with the spiced ice cream . Black Daal - so full of flavors yet so buttery and rich . I could ' ve just eaten this as a meal . I added enjoyed dipping the Okra fries in this . Garlic Naan - Great , but not particularly special . necessary to eat every last drop of Chicken Ruby and Pau Bhaji . Dishoom Slaw Super refreshing when eaten with all the other dishes ! Okra Fries - seasoned perfectly and lightly fried . These were a great change of texture compared to everything I ' ve mentioned above . Pass : Chicken biryani - kind of plain . perfectly fine , but unnecessary . Gunpowder potatoes - Good , but nothing special . Quick note about the wait . You can make reservations for breakfast and lunch . If you go for dinner you have to wait in line . The first time I went they told us the wait was 1 . 5 hours and it ended up being more like 1 . The second time , they said 1 hour and it was about 30 mins . Seriously , don ' t let the line scare you ! They also pass out green tea , chai , and sherry while you wait .\n",

It was intimidating to look at the menu and only recognize the name of 1 or 2 items , but our waiter was extremely helpful in his recommendations and descriptions of his favorites . This is what our party of 4 ordered and shared : Pau Bhaji ( it ' s similar to chili . Served with small rolls ) Chilli Chicken - crispy spicy garlicky pieces of chicken Lamb Boti Kabob - seasoned & grilled lamb ( excellent ! ) House Black Daal - mild , creamy lentils , it ' s like a stewChicken Ruby - 2 pieces of chicken in red sauce Chicken Britannia Biryani Bowl ( a favorite ) Naan ( 2 orders ) Basmati rice ( 2 orders ) Everything was excellent .

      "Example 0: This may be the best Indian food I have ever had . We were quickly seated in a cozy table in the lower level , and the waiter was extremely helpful in explaining the spice levels of each dish , their signature picks , what he recommends to get with what , etc . Even though the menu is quite large , he helped us narrow down our picks . Murgh Malai : These chicken thighs were extremely tender and exploding with rich seasonings . A blackened crust on the outside forms a layer of purely blissful taste that gives way to the moist , soft thigh meat underneath . Fantastic dish ! Chicken Ruby : We were told this is their most popular dish . It is very smooth and the tomato really stands out . Black Daal : Probably my favorite dish here ( it ' s close between this and Murgh Malai ) . It ' s savory , buttery , rich , and intensely flavorful . I would be totally satisfied if I had this and some naan for my meal . Mutton Pepper Fry ( Covent Garden special ) : Moderately spicy , and oh so good . The spices really bring everything else to life , and gives your meal the kick it needs . The mutton is very tender and the sauce really penetrates the meat . It comes with delicious parathi bread . Garlic Naan : Even the naan is amazing at Dishoom . Amazing garlic - y flavors - soft , fresh , and doughy . Mango Lassi : Best mango lassi I have ever had . It tasted extremely fresh , and the fennel seeds added more complexity to the taste . I downed this pretty quickly . . . One thing I love about this place is that the portion sizes are small . You can choose to go cheap and just get a daal and rice / naan , or you can splurge and try many things . Another thing I love is that every dish is outstanding . You really can ' t go wrong , and with a menu this big you can keep coming back and discovering new things . Also this place is VERY AFFORDABLE . A + in every regard .

      "Example 0: London is known for it ' s amazing Indian food and there are tons of Indian restaurants all over the city . This place was recommended by a few friends and the crazy Yelp reviews made me want to try this place during my trip to London . I made reservations prior to my trip for lunch on a Friday . We got here 15 minutes before noon ( our reservation time ) and were immediately seated . At that time the wait for others was around 30 minutes . When we left the place , there was already a line outside . The service was amazing and our waiter was very attentive and friendly . Here is what we ordered : - Bhel : delicious . Loved that it was not soaked in tamarind chutney . - Okra Fries : loved it ! ! ! Wasn ' t sure what to expect but these were seasoned perfectly and we finished it off in no time . - Paav Bhaji : loved it ! ! ! ! The bhaji was so well cooked and the bread was fresh and toasted to perfection . - House Daal : soooo good ! ! ! I was so full with the other food that I couldn ' t finish the daal . As I ' m writing this review , I ' m craving that daal . Yes it was yummy . - Roomali Roti : this was a bit dry . In India these are so soft that they melt on your mouth . This one turned dry as it got cold . - House Chai : perfect for a cold day . It was a bit sweet for my taste but so delicious . My hubby got Murg Malai and said it was as good as what you get in India . Overall I ' m a huge fan of this place and would love to come back and try their other dishes . Would I wait an hour to eat here ? ? No - as there are tons of amazing Indian restaurants in London . Make a reservation and enjoy the food .\n",

      "Example 0: After eating here I can understand why people stand in line at every location of this mini chain st all hours of the day and night . Really fab Indian food . The queue is no joke . They quoted 1 . 5 hours for two people on a Saturday night . It goes fast and you can enjoy a complimentary chai or sherry while you wait . It ' s a bit deceiving because getting to the front of the line gets you only as far as a seat at the bar where you get a pager and wait some more . Eventually you make it to the table . Servers are friendly and food comes out pretty quickly . We loved the black daal , garlic naan , chili broccoli salad ( it has a kick ! ) , and veg curry . I didn ' t love the pineapple that came with the grilled paneer cheese - the flavor combo just didn ' t work for me . Roti bread - think fresh made tortilla - was ok , but not worth 3 . 20£ for a single piece and not as good as the garlic naan . Would recommend , but plan ahead for the wait time .\n",

I will say the restaurant does a fabulous job of helping with the long waits with bringing around chai and drinks . We chatted with others in line so it went by pretty quickly . It was also a Saturday evening in the middle of the summer so we expected long waits . After we were seated , we ordered chicken tikka , chicken tikka wrap , Dahl , Chile chicken , sauces with chips , naan and butter chicken . Overall hits and misses . While the food was delicious I expected a bit more because of the hype and the fact that it ' s Indian food in London . Chicken tikka : 3 stars . I expected the creamy gravy based dish I always order at Indian restaurants however that wasn ' t the case here . It ' s dry and too salty for me . Chicken tikka role : 3 stars . It ' s ehh . Best part is the bread which you can order on the side Dahl : 2 stars . I think this was the worst . Tasted burntChile chicken : 4 . 5 stars . Best dish of the night Butter chicken : 4 stars . Standard but delicious Naan : 2 . 5 stars . Burnt and hard . Red flag . Not worth the hype in my opinion but maybe I just have different tastes .\n"

And waitstaff was courteous and attentive . I did hear my server making the SAME recommendation over and over for the house special ( and he told me I shouldn ' t get lamb ) , but sometimes they push what they want to sell . - 4 stars for decor and ambience . Upstairs is brighter , louder and more expansive , while downstairs is dark and cozy . Almost too dark - me and others had to use flashlights on our phones to see the menu . However it is a bit romantic down there . bathrooms are nice too . - 3 . 5 for food . I ordered fried okra for an appetizer and some kind of chicken for a main . Both were salty and neither were particularly pleasing to my palate . I was warned the chicken came with no sauce but still expected them to be juicy since they were chicken thighs . wrong !

It ' s slightly sweet , a bit spicy but was edible for me , and the rest there was just lots of unknown spices in it , with some basil and tomato notes . The chicken was very tender . House Black Daal : AIt ' s less spicy than chicken ruby , there were beans in it , and that ' s all I know how to describe it , I guess I don ' t have enough vocabulary to describe Indian dishes , all I knew was it ' s super yummy . Roti : ADon ' t forget this most important dish in order to dip into the two sauces above . The texture was very soft , there ' s some grilled taste to it and there ' s not really any other flavor to it , which was on point because I could truly enjoy the sauces flavor without distraction . Dishoom is a restaurant I must go back whenever I have a chance to visit London again !\n",

I was surprised that at 2pm on a Monday there was already a line . Luckily they served the folks waiting in line lemonade for the first waiting area on the street . Once we were moved into the final waiting area downstairs in front of the bar , we were a little disappointed that we couldn ' t order a drink . We literally just sat there until we were called . Once that wait was over , we were seated in the top floor and were met by our server quickly . We ordered the Rose and Cardamom Lassi , Aflatoon ' s colada , and the Fresh Nimbu Soda , which were unique and delicious . For food , the Black Daal , Spicy Lambchops , Samosas , Chicken Ruby and Garlic Naan were our go to selections . Everything was incredible except for the Black Daal , it was surprisingly bland .

It was simply one of the best meals we ' ve had during our time in London . We liked it so much that we we went back there twice to try their breakfast and lunch menu as well . The food is genuinely authentic and to a wonderful quality . Everything is well made and you should work your way through the menu . The Okra fries , Chili cheese toast are definitely worth trying . Their mutter paneer , ruby curry accompanied with garlic naan / roti was a good mix , great for vegetarians as well . Fantastic food , make sure you make a reservation because there ' s always a line . But it looked like they had chai for those waiting when it was cold . They take no customer for granted and want to make you feel at home . We also got some chai on the house at the end , which really felt as a great way to finalize our already amazing dinner experience . Food , drinks and service were perfect ! Goes without saying it ' s probably one of the best Indians in town . Covent Garden branch definitely better than others . Highly recommended ! PS : They sell their own coins which is quite cute .

      "Example 0: We enjoyed Dishoom for dinner so much that we needed to get another taste before we left London . As our flight is in the afternoon , we opted for breakfast . This time we went to Dishoom at Covent Garden . The opened at 9 and we were the third table to sit . By 9 : 30 , the room was pretty much filled . We ordered the big Bombay ( which is essentially their version of the English breakfast ) , the keema per eedu , and the famous bacon naan roll . Oh and chai as well . The chai isn ' t as sweet as the typical ones we get which was great . It was quite delicious . I thoroughly enjoyed the big Bombay and keema as well . These are hearty breakfast choices of course but the better ones in my opinion . The bacon naan was good but not as amazing as I thought it would be .

      "Example 0: We came here on multiple recommendations of friends who live in London & others who have visited . They don ' t let you book a reservation for parties less than 6 for dinner so be prepared to wait a long time for dinner unless you come before their rush ( I . e . before 6 : 30pm ) . We arrived around 7 : 30pm and told there was an hr and a half wait ( it was accurate ) . They make the line enjoyable enough with offerings of delicious chai tea and mint tea while you wait . It is very rare that I would line up for an hr and a half for anything ( unless I ' m at Disneyland ) but all the recommendations made me think this was food worth waiting for . It certainly was . We asked the waiter for his recommendations & explanations of the menu . He was very knowledgeable and helpful . We ordered the vegetable samosas to start . Thankfully after the long line we didn ' t have to wait long to actually receive our food . The samosas were remarkably complex in flavors and the accompanying sauces were a perfect compliment to them . We ordered the Chicken Ruby , Black Daal and Paneer Tikka with Roti . I honestly don ' t know how to describe them . I was so lost in the flavors and the experience , I ' m left speechless . I have to note that often I ' ve had paneer in a curry and I ' ve found it akin to tofu , seeming to lack in flavor . Not so at Dishoom . The paneer is grilled and packed with flavor especially combined with the pineapple and a squeeze of lime . This is a meal that will threaten your good table manners and make you want to pick up your plate and lick it clean . We couldn ' t leave without dessert so we finished the meal off with the Gulab Jamun ( a dumpling with citrus ice cream ) and the Malai Kulfi ( like an ice cream stick with a light caramel flavor ) . I ordered the Gulab Jamun and was amazed at the flavor combo . I wasn ' t sure about having a dumpling with citrus ice cream but the flavors married perfectly . I tried to come up with things to compare the dumpling to give you an image but nothing suffices . Just order it and thank me later . The ambience was lovely . The interior is beautiful and well designed . Bonus : if you get to sit near the kitchen , it is entertaining to watch the chefs make the naan . They make it look so easy ! I would come back here and wait in that line again any day .\n",

There are numerous locations throughout London but this spot was the most convenient for us . The long queue outside might seem daunting but it moves pretty quickly and there are people offering you hot tea as you wait in the freezing cold . As you get closer , there are heat lamps that temporarily help . Once you ' re ushered into the restaurant , you think you ' re about to be seated but you ' re just transferred to the downstairs bar area while you wait for a table to open up . My favorite dish at Dishoom has to be the chicken ruby . It ' s AMAZING . The curry is phenomenal and we had to order more garlic naan to wipe the rest of the curry clean ! I just can ' t stop thinking about that delicious curry ! The chicken was terrific and was soft and tender . Another favorite of mine was the lamb biryani . The lamb was properly cooked ( super tender ) and the spices in the bowl were spot on . I could go on and on about how great Dishoom is but you might be reading for a while .

      "Example 0: If Yelp let me give 6 stars , I would . Dishoom is absolutely incredible ! Pro tip : get lunch here ! We arrived at 11 : 30 , without reservations for a party of 4 and 2 high chairs , and waited about 40 minutes for a table inside , which I thought was extremely reasonable ( the line snaked around the building by the time we finished an hour and change later ) . The hostess and waiter were both extremely kind and accommodating for our 2 little ones , which was above and beyond . The atmosphere on the inside is trendy Bombay meets diner and was adorable . Downstairs was even cozier and more intimate . We started with the hot chai , which is the best I have ever had , ( you could even get it spiked ) ! The waiter was excellent and walked us through the menu and gave glowing recommendations . He let us know that everyone orders about 2 - 3 items , which was a ton of food , even with big appetites . We settled on the chili chicken ( absolutely banging ) , chicken tikka ( INCREDIBLE ) , a lamb biryani and chicken briyani ( both spicy yet delightful ) , chicken ruby ( basically a butter chicken with sauce so amazing I want to bathe in it ) , and the gunpowder potatoes . We added some raita , a yogurt sauce , to cool everything off . The seasoning on everything was impeccable , and while I loved it all , the chicken ruby and chicken tikka exceeded all expectations and were absolutely flawless . The price point was exceptional , considering everything is meant to be shared . The overall experience was everything I wanted and more ! A must if traveling in London !\n",

      "Example 0: Delicious take on Indian Food , that came highly recommended by a number of friends and online reviews . If you are going to be in London do yourself a favor and just make a reservation ! You ' ll end up wanting to dine here and regret it because the wait anytime of day is LONG . I had both dinner here and breakfast here and overall really loved the food . However , during my breakfasts I had an extremely negative experience with the service that took away a star . I had dinner for 1 , in between the Harry Potter shows . Even with a reservation I had to wait about 10 mins to be seated , they are just packed . It was really nice seeing them serve chai tea to those waiting , unfortunately I just missed it as I was about to be seated . I ordered some with my dinner and it was fabulously spiced , but not to sweet and comes with refills . I ' m lactose intolerant , but this was WORTH IT to break out a pill . Ordered the Ruby Chicken , Black Dal , Rice , and Veggies . Everything was delicious , but wish they had another veggie option . It was just roasted broccoli and snow peas bland and limp . They are known for the black dal and it was rich and flavorful . The Ruby Chicken was creamy and tomatoey ! I found this to be way too much food for one but was glad to get the variety . Server was great , but super busy . I appreciated he got me in and out as quick as he could and knew that bc of my reservation notes of my time constraints between shows already . Breakfast was delicious , I had to come and try their bacon naan roll fusion take on a breakfast sandwich . It was such an incredible , come in and order it ! I made a reservation for 8am with notes I needed to be out as soon as possible within 45mins to catch a flight . However , the service was surprisingly rude . I got there before they opened at 8am . There we 3 groups waiting , and the servers made a big deal about the two other groups not having reservations . However no one was there , and it remained pretty empty throughout breakfast ( Monday morning ) . The group seated before me was also Asian and they just automatically grouped me in with them despite standing quite separately and having all my luggage with me as a lone traveler . She seemed quite flustered when I mentioned I wasn ' t with them , with a very sassy \" Oh , well do you have a reservation then ? \" I was then seated right by the door , along the staffs ' main throughway between kitchen counter bar to the rest of the restaurant . Because of all the luggage and completely empty restaurant I asked if I could be seated in a less busy location , so my luggage would be in the way . She dismissed this comment and said this was fine . It was too early for me to argue with this and thought she ' d know best . However , I regret not insisting because the next 40 mins that followed was almost every staff member hitting and stumbling past my luggage . Yet somehow I never saw my waitress to even be able to ask for a water refill or get the bill . Never asked if my food was OK , it was delivered by a kitchen staff member . I waited over 10 minutes , after finishing my meal and still no water before getting up to flag another server dow , which is just so awkward ! In conclusion , loved the food , will be back . However , while breakfast was great , what a shocking miss in service at breakfast .\n",

      "Example 0: Dishoom is a beloved string of modern Indian restaurants in London . Though you ' ll find classic dishes like murgh malai and lamb samosas , Dishoom ' s rendition of Indian food is through the lens of Irani cafes in Bombay . The Covent Garden location is largely walk - in , and rain and shine you ' ll find shivering hordes waiting to get in and being treated to delicious cups of hot and milky chai . We timed it relatively well on a Sunday night and ended up waiting about 30 minutes to get in , and then another 15 at the bar . The cocktail list is long and to - theme , including a thoughtful list of mocktails . The majority are 8 . 50 pounds . Cyrus Irani , my choice , was a straightforward tequila sour ; Debonair was a fine frozen drink . By far the best drink here is the Hoppy Paanch , an IPA , Johnny Walker , and butter syrup concoction that tastes far better than that description . I drank most of my boyfriend ' s ( oops ) . Once seated in the cozy and buzzing downstairs , we ordered everything to share , with a little help from our waiter . Complimentary papadum with tri - colored dips was a satisfying , if standard , way to start off the meal ; pau bhaji and okra fries ( 4 . 50 each ) were both well - done and nice ways to continue our carb streak . Our larger plates were spiced and fragrant gunpowder potatoes ( 6 . 70 ) ; decent lamb chops ( 12 . 90 ) strewn with pomegranate seeds ; a fine chicken ruby ( 10 . 50 ) ; and a delicious but small prawn dish ( 17 . 50 ) . Although we were happily in a food orgy , mopping up sauces with naan , I couldn ' t help but wonder what I was missing . Everything was done well , but nothing was really above and beyond in the way that , say , Pondicheri in Houston is . Prices are elevated but not too bad ; we had a bill around 75 pounds for our party of four ( excluding drinks ) , and that was somewhat inflated by the prawns . Service is rushed but reasonable given the popularity . Bathrooms are very nice . Decor and atmosphere in general is great . I understand why Dishoom is a must - go in London , and it has plenty of convenient locations , but I was expecting something just a little extra .\n"

      "Example 0: You know a place is good when you get multiple recommendations from various friends before a trip . Four different friends recommended Dishoom . I definitely wanted to eat Indian food while in London , so I was determined to try Dishoom . It took me three tries to eat there , but when I finally did have dinner there , I was not disappointed . I saw the line down the sidewalk one day and decided to come back the next day . I ' m glad I got there somewhat early ( 4 : 30p ) because I still had to wait 40 minutes . They offered some sort of milk drink in the line , but I didn ' t have any . I did have some water , when I was able to wait at the bar for my table . My server was so helpful and provided suggestions . I was starving , but didn ' t want to order too much food so he helped me pick out some dishes . I started with the okra fries . They were so damn good . I could have just eaten the okra and beensatisfied lol . I love okra so much . The seasoning and the crispiness of the breading was just different and delicious . I ordered the East India Gimlet and it was also very good . It wasn ' t terribly sweet which is what I prefer . For my main course I had the Murgh Malai ( incredibly tender and delicious ) , Chicken Ruby ( the sauce was soooo good ) , and garlic naan . When the food came out , I was still chowing down on the okra fries . My server came over and kindly told me to eat my main dish before it got cold LOL . I devoured everything . I really wish we had Dishoom in the States . I would be eating there on a weekly basis . Amazing food , great service ! Definitely worth the wait ! Dishoom will be a must the next time I visit London .\n",

      "Example 0: It is well known that London has a sprawling Indian food scene that serves some of the best Indian cuisines outside of India . Dishoom , a small chain of seven \" Bombay Cafes \" , is definitely on the top of the list for both locals and tourists alike . Online reservations can be made for breakfast and lunch only . They do not accept reservations for dinner and the only way to get in is the old traditional way - stand in line ! There have been times when we walked past a Dishoom during dinner hours and saw lines wrapping around the block . The \" Bombay Café \" style features a casual but moderately upscale and comfortable environment with cool vibes . The atmosphere is friendly and vibrant , and is always a perfect place to chill , and to grab some yummy Indian food with a couple of bottles of Kingfisher . VEGETABLE SAMOSAS : The skin was paper - thin and fried to a perfect crispiness that when I sank my teeth into it , the skin just crumbled and melted away while the filling made with veggies and mashed potatoes greeted my mouth with a warmly spicy yumminess . CHICKEN RUBY : It looked like a variation of the famous tikka Marsala which was a tomato based curry with cubed chicken breast meat . The ruby dish , however , came with makhani sauce which was silky and smooth . It really tasted like tikka Marsala but with a stronger flavor of ginger and garlic . It had a nice balance of sweetness versus spiciness and was delicious beyond words . GUNPOWDER POTATOES : If you asked me to recommend a \" must - order \" item then this is it , not just because it was so amazingly good , but also because you can ' t find this anywhere else . Skin - on potatoes were fire grilled , cut into pieces , then sautéed with butter and an abundance of peppers and exotic spices . It was without a doubt one of the most memorable potato dishes that I ' ve ever had . We also had a roti to mop up the sauce from the ruby chicken , some rice , and a bowl of vegetables . Everything was good beyond belief . 5 stars +\n",

      "Example 0: I have to say this restaurant is overrated . Their food is good , but it ' s not that good . They do not take reservations . We waited for about 35 minutes or so outside and then 15 minutes or so at the bar downstairs . Once again , their food is good but I don ' t think it ' s worth waiting for close to an hour . We ordered the lamb chops ( my favorite ) , murgh malai , and chicken ruby . I would give 4 stars for the food , but with the long wait , I cannot give more than 3 stars . Pro - Tip : Even if the queue looks relatively short outside , it ' s likely to be a long wait as there are people waiting for their tables at the bar downstairs . I would not return to Dishoom nor do I recommend this to anyone . There are many other good restaurants in London and there ' s also better way to spend time than waiting in line . * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * If you found something useful in my review , please hit \" useful \" so that I can improve my reviews .

It was only later that I ' d notice that Ruggy and other Yelp dignitaries had experienced the majesty of this modern Indian tapas hangout slinging traditional street flavors . Being jetlagged and coming here at 4 : 30 pm probably helped my cause of getting in without much fuss . The wait was about 5 minutes and only the arrival of my East India Gimlet and lamb samosas were able to drown out the guilt I felt over snagging a three - person table by myself .

I stood there for awhile contemplating weather or not I thought I ' d make it in and have enough time to enjoy dinner before realizing it just was not going to happen . I asked the host what time they close and if they are this busy after theatre . He mentioned there would be a wait later in the evening before they close but it wouldn ' t be this long at all . I decided then I ' d hop out of the line and go to theatre hungry . I came back at around 1015P and waited for around 20 minutes and enjoyed the best dinner . All of my usual , very basic ( I know ) menu items : somosas , Ruby Chicken , Rice , Cheese Naan , a beer and their delish warm chai tea they pass out to the folks waiting outside in the cold for a table . Service was friendly , food arrived quickly and I was in and out in less than an hour . I ' d definitely recommend dining here but planning it out accordingly since no one really enjoys waiting long periods of time to eat .\n"

      "Example 0: This place is THE PLACE . I wanna start by saying that I am dying to hop back across the pond and get in for dinner solely based on how BOMB my brunch experience was here at Dishoom Covent Garden . I ' ve heard non - stop chat about how great this place is , so I was very happy to get in and try it out myself . I ' m just gonna go ahead and let y ' all know what I had and why it was the best : If you like meat ( and boy do I ever ) , then you HAFTA order the Wrestler ' s Naan Roll : smoked streaky bacon , peppery pork sausages , and runny - yolked egg . . . Perfectly cooked bacon and sausage , with a brilliantly cooked egg with JUST the right amount of runny - yolk ! This was one of the best breakfasts I had while in London . ON TOP OF their tasty food ( and incredibly reasonable prices ) , is the House Chai . . . which is bottomless ! Get the Chai . It comes out PIPING hot , so be careful with that first sip , and has the most comforting and satisfying spice taste !\n",

      "Example 0: I must return . With all the hype , I was surprised even MORE people aren ' t talking about this place . I love Indian food to begin with , but this goes far past the food . The queue was obviously long . But worth the wait . Mostly for such hospitable waiters who came by with different drinks like warm chai tea or sherry wine or lemonade . All so delicious too . Then it started raining and they brought out large umbrellas ! The staff , for working at such a popular , busy restaurant , were friendly , upbeat , and playful ! I loved that they weren ' t grudgingly leading the next millionth customer to a table . Can we talk about the atmosphere ? The hanging lights ? The beautiful decor ? I was head over heels for everything . Even the toilet ! The lamb chops were definitely delicious . My friend ordered garlic naan to share , and I was surprised the garlic was actually so present in comparison to other sad naans I ' ve had . Definitely wouldn ' t mind using up another London trip to eat here again . Beware of an hour wait though ! It ' ll be worth it .\n",

      "Example 0: Having Indian food in London is really a special experience . No matter where you go you will experience flavors and styles that are very different from what you usually find in the states . That being said , Dishoom was an exceptional experience from beginning to end . It was an unusually windy and cold night when we went and there was a queue outside and a quoted 45 minute wait . We dutifully got on line and were super impressed by how organized the door hosts were and how we were offered complementary hot drinks numerous times . The inside of the restaurant is fantastic . Love how it ' s decorated - feels very different and yet special compared to most Indian restaurants . The menu can be a little overwhelming but we tried a bunch of items and loved everything . The biryani was outstanding and all the sauces and sides were incredibly flavorful . I would love to have something similar in the states , but I guess I will have to find another excuse to visit England and to go back !\n",

The first time , my dining partner and I ordered a variety of dishes and tried two different types of cocktails each . While I don ' t remember the cocktails anymore ( I believe they were whiskey sours ) , I do remember that they were delicious - although not the most alcoholic . We shared the plain naan , chicken biryani , house black daal , and spicy lamb chops . I loved the spicy lamb chops and ate all of it since my partner was vegetarian : ) ; the chicken biryani , although huge , was a bit too bland for my taste with dry chicken . The next time , another dining partner and I tried the jackfruit biryani , and cheese naan . GET THE CHEESE NAAN . It was the most delicious thing I ' ve ever had . Also , I loved the different types of Kulfi on a stick - my dining partner from India said it should ' ve been only a few cents on the streets of New Delhi , but I didn ' t mind spending a few bucks for the most delicious and creamy dessert of my life . Great service - make a reservation and you ' ll be all set !\n",

      "Example 0: Came to this place with a couple friends for dinner . They had us sampling chai tea and lemonade while we were waiting in line . The line moved pretty quick and before we know it we were seated . We waited about 45mins which wasn ' t bad . We ordered 4 entrees for the 4 of us . We also ordered 2 sides which were bowl of greens and basmati rice . All dishes were amazing and it was an awesome experience . Most of their dishes are dry and not saucey like other Indian places I ' ve been to in the past . We were all stuffed and super satisfied with the service and food . Definitely a great place for romantic dinners with the dark atmosphere inside . Even though we were full , we still wanted to order more . It was impossible to stop talking about it after we left the restaurant . Garlic Naan : Oh my god ! The garlic naan was perfect with the chicken ruby we ordered . The naan itself was just as amazing . It had just enough garlic and butter on there to make it super flaky and good . Mahi Tikka : Hands down best dish of the night ! There were 4 big pieces of fish which was perfect for each of us to try one . The fish was super fresh and amazingly good . It pretty much melted in my mouth after taking one bite of it . I ' ve never seen fish at an Indian restaurant before , but man this was literally hands down best dish ever ! I almost wanted to order another one . Chicken Ruby : This was really really good . It was the red tomato sauce with chicken in it . There were big chunks of chicken in there which were super tender . I ordered some rice and ate it with the sauce . The sauce wasn ' t super overpowering the chicken or over spiced at all . I ' m super picky with my sauce , but this was really good to the point that I would be able to drink it just by itself . Dishoom Chicken Tikka : This was probably one of their signature dishes . The chicken thighs were super juicy and smooth . They definitely didn ' t over cook the chicken . I will definitely come back when I visit London again .\n"

      "Example 0: When in London , one must Dishoom ! This restaurant really embodies the true British - Indian cuisine of London , showing how traditional flavors can be highlighted by subtle western undertones . If you are a vegetarian , then this restaurant is an excellent choice . If you are an omnivore , please given the vegetarian dishes here a chance because they are much tastier than the meat options . The house black dal is delicious . Yes who knew that dal , which is one of the average Patel ' s staples in Indian . could be such poetry to one ' s palate ? ! I am still dreaming of this dal for weeks after my trip . Dal is simply made of lentils , but the way it was slowly cooked in the cream highlights the richness of natural legume flavor . Dip it in roti , nan , eat it with a spoon - however you like and it can ' t be wrong ! Again , the veggie dishes here are the stars ! The pau bhaji , which is essentially mashed veggies served with butter buns is a wonderful fusion delight . The buttery buns are warm out of the over and go deliciously with this spicy veggie concoction . It tastes almost like samosa filling of potatoes , chickpeas , peas , and carrots ? Not sure what exactly is in here but it is awesomeness . Next on the list is the chole puri , which is equally vegetarian and delicious . It comes with 2 puffed puri ( a fried airy dough usually eaten by Indians during celebrations ) , with yummy side dips like chickpea curry and sweet hawla . I like how the 2 different sides complement each other with bites of sweet and savory . I love prawns and the masala prawns were no different . They were so juicy and tender , slathered in deep smoky spices of coriander and chilies . Soooo good , I had to eat the last one even though I was about to explode . The chicken ruby is Dishoom ' s take on chicken makhani and it held up the standard of a rich tomato - based curry . I love chicken makhani and it ' s rarely bad - as long as there is tender succulent chicken bathed in a creamy spicy curry , then I am happy . This made me happy . I hope Dishoom continues to grow and deliver its high quality London - style Indian food . Please consider expanding to NYC in the future !\n",

      "Example 0: Quick summary : Delicious Indian cuisine in a lively upscale locationI made reservations to eat here long before I came to town because I was way too excited about trying the food that local and non - local Yelpers rave about . The ability to make reservations online way in advance is an automatic plus - one rating from me . First thing I noticed was that there was a huge line forming outside in the rain . Once I mentioned the reservation , we were led to our table on the ground floor immediately . The kitchen is on this level , so you can see the craziness from your seat . There is a downstairs portion of this restaurant , which I was grateful to not be seated in because there are no windows and I get claustrophobic . However , when I went down there to use the restroom I notice it was very interestingly decorated , with little alcoves for your party and different artwork . It probably is also less hectic and provides more intimate seating . Here are the dishes I tried with photos attached : Keema Pau - spiced lamb appetizer to get you goingMasala Prawns - Large , grilled , and seasonedRoomali Roti - A paper thin bread Chicken Ruby - Luxurious chicken curryGarlic Naan - Personal favorite for any Indian mealThe food here is well spiced , fresh , and cooked to perfection . It definitely lived up to the hype and has earned return visits and recommendations from me . The service was impeccable as well .

      "Example 0: A unique Indian dining experience , far different from the more traditional restaurants I have experienced in the past . Dishoom creates a fresh , modern take on classic Bombay cuisine in a visually stunning ambiance . Gilded light fixtures , beautiful antique photos , dark wood details , and intricately tiled floors provide a glamorous fine dining vibe . The interior is enormous , with two floors of seating . This would be a good place to come with a large group . Service was elusive and difficult to summon , but the place is super hectic so we did not really mind . To drink I tried the Rose Lassi , which was delicious . Nice subtle floral flavors , and the perfect amount of sweetness . We shared the Gunpowder Potatoes and Bowl of Greens , both of which were simple , flavorful plant based sides that would compliment any entree . My main was the Jackfruit Biryani , which was excellent . The jackfruit was not shredded as I expected , but served as larger chunks in a bowl of rice . Richly spiced and deeply savory , the tender meat substitute provided a perfect contrast to the aromatic basmati rice . The trio of condiment sauces served on the side further enhanced the complex flavors - do not skip on adding these to your food . My boyfriend does not like Indian food ( at all ) , and enjoyed his wrap . Lunch for two came to just around £45 - a bargain considering the quality of ingredients and generous portions . I would not hesitate to recommend Dishoom .\n",

Came on a weekday afternoon for lunch and was seated right away . The decor is rustic with a mix of contemporary - not like your typical North American designed Indian restaurants which was unique . I really liked the vibe here - not too loud with bustling kitchen sounds and aromatic Indian food being prepared . There ' s cut - outs of articles on the wall and marble tables . . . it ' s quite aesthetic I have to say . I wasn ' t too overly impressed with the service , in fact I would say that ' s what takes away part of the stars for my rating . The waiter was questioning whether I knew Indian food ( I definitely do , ahem ) . . . in any case the food arrived swiftly . I got the matar paneer which was a curry made with soft cheese ( tofu like texture ) and the naan t accompany it ( costs extra ) and my friend got the biryani . The paneer was delicious and definitely had authentic flavours ( can confirm authenticity after having paneer in India a few months back ) . However , this place was quite pricey for lunch . . . I ' d go back occasionally if it was in my route . For the price I ' d expect much better service and a more unique menu instead of standard Indian fare . In all not a bad experience and if you ' re in the area ( Trafalgar Square ) definitely venture in !\n"

Definitely worth the hype , it had a sweetish taste to it . We also got the house daal . I ' m personally not a lentil person so this dish was mediocre for me but it can really fill you up . We got both the rotti and garlic naan with it . The rotti was quite thin and couldn ' t absorb all the curry so we had to get another order of garlic naan which was amazing , hot and fresh . Overall the food is delicious and worth the line ! Price : while individual items are average priced , piling on altogether can add up to a large bill in the end . It is worth it if you enjoy Indian cuisine though . Atmosphere : the restaurant itself was decorated in a colonial style , the ambient was dark and intimate . Nonetheless the service was lovely a albeit a bit slow at prime dinner time ( around 7 pm ) . Tips : Be aware of the lines ! If you didn ' t make a reservation , the wait could be up to 2 hours ! From our experience , the smaller the party the better for 2 - seaters are easier to come by .\n",

      "Example 0: This restaurant was fantastic and everyone should find a way to eat here ! If you are coming for lunch or dinner , my suggestion is to make a reservation . We came here for lunch on a Wednesday and arrived at 11 : 55 and just barely got a table for 2 ! The place was packed . We ordered : - Rose & Pistachio Lassi ( must order ) - Pav Bhaji ( must order ) - Lamb Biriyani ( must order but try the chicken instead ) - Ruby Chicken Curry - Palak Paneer - Naan The food was all 5 stars . I highly recommend ordering the biriyani . It tasted just like my mom ' s homemade biriyani which takes 2 days to make - with the exception of Dishoom ' s lamb being a little tough and the cashews not being roasted . When I took my first bite , I was sent back 15 years to my childhood . It was incredible . Next time I come here I want to order the chicken biriyani . Now that I am back in Boston , I am craving that rose and pistachio lassi . As soon as it was served to me , I slurped it down in under 1 minute . The rose wasn ' t over powering at all and the lassi was light but had amazing flavor . Next time we are in London , we will definitely be back here ! What was really nice too was that the whole restaurant is decorated with family memorabilia - even the bathroom stalls !\n",

      "Example 0: Trust me when I say the 60 min + wait is totally worth it ! We wanted to enjoy our last meal in London , so I suggested we do Indian since 1 . it is popular in London and 2 . it is our favorite cuisine to eat . We arrived here on a Monday night at 8 : 00pm and were told an hour wait . We got in the line and were immediately brought complimentary chai tea while we waited . Once we made it to the front of the line we were invited to have drinks and snacks at the bar downstairs . This was after about 30 minutes of waiting outside . We sat at stools near the bar but decided to just wait until seated to order any alcohol . About 10 minutes after we moved downstairs , we were shown to our dining table . Our server was very knowledgeable and happily shared suggestions and recommendations . Everything is served family - style and the portions are smaller so it ' s recommended 4 - 5 dishes for 2 people . We started with the lamb samosas , which come 3 per order . The outside was crisp and the lamb was well - seasoned and plentiful inside . We ordered the mahi tikka , adwahi lamb , and the ruby chicken along with 2 orders of garlic naan . * Mahi tikka : this is sustainable Asian basa fillet in a subtle yoghurty marinade . This was a nice and light dish and tasted good with the extra lime . Even though this was good it was my least favorite and I let my husband eat most of it . * Adwahi lamb : The lamb is prepared with stock and spices , then layered with rice and cooked in traditional ' dum ' style . This was deliciously spicy ! Really generous portion too . The lamb was well seasoned and tender . * Ruby chicken : Tender chicken in a rich silky ' makhani ' sauce . This was my favorite dish ! Very rich and flavorful and creamy . Best mopped up with garlic naan ! Lots of tender , well - flavored chicken mixed in . * garlic naan : Some of the best garlic naan I ' ve ever had ! We ordered one order with butter and one without . I ' m sure you can guess which was preferred at our table ! The naan was soft and well - cooked and evenly flavored with garlic . When visiting London , Indian food is always a solid option and look no further than Dishoom to provide a 5 star dining experience ! From getting in line until walking out the door , we both felt well - taken care of and that we were valued customers .\n",

      "Example 0: Located in bustling Covent Garden , Dishoom is likely the most popular Indian restaurant in all of London . 1 . What is the restaurant like ? Dishoom offers a nice ambience that caters to a diverse patron base : families , friend groups , and significant others on a special date . Upstairs and downstairs seating is available . 2 . What is the wait like ? On a Wednesday evening at 7 : 30 pm , we were quoted a 1 hr wait . We expected that we would have a chance to explore the area after putting our names down , but Dishoom requires that all customers wait in line . To placate hungry customers in line , the restaurant offers warm chai tea and small bites . 3 . What should you order ? According to our waiter , the restaurant ' s famed dishes are the chicken ruby , prawns , house black daal , and calamari . We ordered several dishes suggested by our waiter including the calamari , chicken ruby , house black daal , spicy lamb chops , bowl of greens , cheese naan , and garlic naan . The calamari was a nice starter that we enjoyed with the various dips , especially the spicy house sauce . Among the other plates we ordered , our favorite was the chicken ruby , which was pleasantly less creamy than the chicken tikka masala that we are accustomed to but loaded with just as much flavor . It served as the perfect accompaniment to the naan . We liked the other plates that we ordered , though we would have preferred the spicy lamb chops to have been cooked a tad less longer . Overall , we were extremely happy with our meal and left with content bellies . Dishoom was a fantastic first meal upon our arrival in London , and we would undoubtedly return .\n",

      "Example 0: I love Dishoom ! I ' ve been here once before a while back and was so excited to have the opportunity to eat here again . It definitely holds up ! We got to Dishoom around 6pm and waited approximately 30 minutes to get inside for dinner . The line moved quite quickly and it was very nice that they provided mint tea and lemonade while we waited . Once inside , our waitress ran us through the menu and we ended up ordering garlic naan ( £3 . 5 ) , basmati rice ( £3 . 20 ) , chicken ruby ( £10 . 90 ) , paneer pineapple tikka ( £8 . 70 ) , house black daal ( £6 . 50 ) , and the vegetable samosas ( £4 . 20 ) . We also ordered an Aflatoon ' s Colada ( £5 . 50 ) and passionfruit Sharbat ( £3 . 90 ) . This was plenty of food for the two of us and we even had some leftover . Everything was delicious ! The chicken ruby is very similar to butter chicken , the house black daal was creamy and delicious , the paneer was not what I expected as I usually order it in a sauce , but delicious nonetheless , and the samosas were nice and crispy . The garlic naan and basmati rice were also perfect companions to the more flavorful food ! In addition , the drinks we got were both fruity , unique and refreshing ! Unfortunately , by the time our dinner was finished , there was no chai left . I ' m not quite sure why that was the case , as it was only 8 , but truly a huge disappointment ! !

We both had the bacon naan roll and it was delish ! I had also ordered the fire toast , but it wasn ' t anything special . Just toast , but the home - made preserves : pineapple - pink - peppercorn jam , and tangy orange marmalade with star anise was yummy ! My friend really loved the dinner menu and wanted me to try AND only another 30 mins till dinner menu , soooooooooooooooooooooooo we decided to stay ! ! ! ! We took our time eating and chatting . I had ordered the house chai and that was great decision , plus free refills ! ! The lassi with fennel was something else , quite refreshing .

For those of you visiting London , you may hear constant recommendations for Dishoom which I feel may make it more of a \" trendy \" place , but it does deliver on delicious food quality . Apparently , it ' s a relatively newer bunch of restaurant that has expanded rapidly ( thus seems to have filled a previously unmet demand for such a restaurant ) . First , there is a wait . Usually 45 minutes to an hour so plan accordingly . The Dishoom at this location is located in a great area with many shops so one could make some use of the time . The interior is large and with dark wood tones . Servers are professional and friendly . Food is great . The dishes are on the smaller size ( think tapas ) . We had the Okra fries , cheese naan , masala prawns , chicken ruby , and spicy lamb chops . All were excellent . Prices are very reasonable for the quality of the food . Overall , we were recommended to this restaurant by at least two people and I now pass on the recommendation . Check it out !\n",

We had originally wanted to come for dinner , but couldn ' t get a a dinner reservation for any Dishoom in London ! But lunch was excellent , and it ' s nice that they save a good chunk of their tables for walk - ins . Our server was very patient , kind , and attentive . She explained many dishes to us and gave us excellent recommendations . We ordered family style so I got to try a bit of everything . I had the : Rose & Cardamom Lassi : so good ! ! ! Very refreshing and I loved the rose flavor . A perfect complement to all the spices . Cheese Naan : oh my gosh , so much cheesy goodness ! ! ! The cheese was plentiful and beautifully melted and the naan had a nice moisture to it . Definitely wish we had ordered more of this . Chicken Ruby : yum ! ! ! ! This is so much less creamy and better than the chicken tikki masala I am used to getting in the States . The chicken was perfectly cooked and the sauce was so delicious . Awadhi Lamb : some of my friends loved this , but It wasn ' t one of my favorites . The lamb flavor was a little too strong ( does that even make sense ? ) for me . Keema Pau : same feelings as with the Awadhi - - I just couldn ' t get behind the lamb here . Dishoom Slaw : a little too much sauce , but it was nice to have something to cool down my mouth . Bowl of Greens : greens ! Yay ! Simple bowls of vegetables that went well with all the sauce and meat we had . Black House Daal : people loved this dish , and they ' re known for making it . I personally thought it was too sweet . Okra Fries : reminded me of some Southern - fried food . A little too oily ( but I always feel this way about fried vegetables ) , but nice to nibble on . Dishoom Calamari : this was delicious ! Nice , light , a little sweet , and with the tiniest of kicks to get your senses going . Pau Bhaji : solid vegetarian dish . Loved the simple flavoring . Not as much of a fan of the bread , but that ' s probably because the Cheese Naan blew me away . Fantastic service , great ambiance , and very affordable prices . Can ' t wait to come back !\n",

      "Example 0: If I could give this place 6 stars , I would . Came upon this place through a recommendation and was very pleased to have the opportunity to check it out . Went for a late dinner and arrived around 9 : 25pm . Even at that hour there was a line 30 minutes deep , but the wait didn ' t seem so bad as the friendly staff handed out complimentary fruit ( grapes and dates ) and drinks ( chai and mint teas ) . Upon getting to the front of the line , you are given a buzzer and directed downstairs to the bar , where you can order drinks and snacks while you wait . Got the Bollybellini , a tasty fruity concoction , and waited no more than a few moments until the host seated us . They were more than accommodating when my companion and I wanted to switch to a different ( read : bigger ) table . Our server Ali was as friendly as could be and even gave us some great recommendations / suggestions . Between us two , we got the vegetable samosas to start ( which we ended up getting an extra order of halfway through our meal - - yes , it was THAT good ! ) along with the Dishoom chicken tikka , spicy lamb chops , Butter - Bhatta , the Black House Daal , garlic naan , and steamed basmati rice . I could have just gotten the Daal with basmati rice and I would have been a happy camper , tbh . But really , everything was delicious and very flavorful ! The garlic naan could have used a little more garlic flavor , but other than that , everything was superb ! Aside from the great food and very attentive , helpful and friendly staff , the prices are reasonable . I would note that this place is more on the trendy side and the size of the dishes are similar to tapas style . Would definitely come back here the next time I ' m in London ! Already itching to try the Chicken Ruby and the Mahi Tikka . Again , Ali was an amazing server if you ' re lucky to get him , and really the whole staff was just top notch ! !\n",

We understand the hype and I still think this place is fantastic . If it makes it any easier , the servers offers hot chai tea to keep you warm in line . : ) The meal was so lovely . We got a little bit of everything to try and although some dishes were spicy , it had a nice kick to it . My favorite dish is the chicken ruby , the very popular chicken dish , that tastes very much like Indian curry with big pieces of chicken . We also got the chicken and lamb dish , which were VERY flavorful and a tad bit salty , but when mixed in with rice , it is a great meal . We ordered the lentils ( the black daahl ) which isn ' t my favorite , but it does taste great when dipped with naan bread ! We opted for a roti bread and a garlic naan which were both steaming when it came out and tasted heavenly dipped in sauce . I would definitely recommend this restaurant to try when in London ! I wish they had a more updated system than having people wait in line . . but hey , it ' s a great marketing technique .\n"

      "Example 0: A memorable dining experience and MUST DO when visiting London . They know how to do Indian food right . : ) Made a reservation for 2 at 5 : 15 on a Friday night . Thanks goodness I did because the line wrapped around the block for daaays ! Though my mom and I didn ' t have the emptiest stomachs for this early dinner , our waitress was kind as to help guide us through the menu ( which is exhaustive ) . She did a perfect job of suggesting that we order 3 - 4 dishes , which were meant to be shared family style . Given our slightly full appetites , my mom and I ordered the dry - rub shrimp masala and chicken tikka ( sp ? ) paired with a side of white rice and the classic naan . I was surprised to find out that my mom , who has a limited palette and low tolerance for spicy foods , actually enjoyed everything ! She found all the flavors to be unique and interesting . The small family - style ( sort of like tapas ) portions were perfect for us and yet even , still a bit much as we had some leftovers . I also ordered the mango fennel lassi , which was delicious ! Sometimes mango lassis can be a bit heavy on the yogurt and sugar , but I felt that the herb - essence from the fennel helped balance it all out . It also didn ' t hurt having this on the side as a chaser when the food got a bit spicy ! For dessert , we had the chocolate fudge with cinnamon ice cream . My mom said she was in chocolate heaven ! The chocolate was warm and gooey and paired well with the cool ice cream . Just decadent ! Ambience was lovely with the trendy Indian , family home character vibes that this gives off ! A lovely and lively place to grab dinner with anyone . Would definitely come back to try more on the menu next time I visit London .\n",

      "Example 0: Yes , I was one of those Americans tricked by the 1500 + reviews , so I stood in <line:Positive Confidence:0.9749689102172852> outside for an hour . The <food:Positive Confidence:0.9900976419448853> , by no means , was bad but most certainly not 4 . 5 stars worthy . We ordered the garlic naan , which barely consisted of any bread . . it was mostly air inside . Also , it had little to no garlic <flavor:Negative Confidence:0.9994994401931763> . My boyfriend got their special coconut curry and the <sauce:Negative Confidence:0.9994314312934875> was soooo WATERY . Wouldn ' t call it a curry ; but rather a soup . I ordered the chicken tikka , and it was too sweet / tomato - y tasting for my preference . I honestly expected a lot more from this place especially with the amount of people waiting outside . Clearly , you guys have not been exposed to divine Indian food ! ! !\n",

      "Example 0: I didn ' t think Indian food would one of my favorite meals in London , but it was ! Dishoom is London ' s first Bombay cafe , and it lives up to the hype . My friends and I arrived around Dishoom on an afternoon around 2 PM , and luckily , we only had to wait about 30 minutes . We ordered the following : - Pau Bhaji ( mashed vegetables with pau buns ) - This was our appetizer to start , and it was delicious ! It was flavorful with a slightly spicy kick , and it came with hot buttered buns to dip in the mashed veggies . - Spicy lamb chops - Deliciously spiced and well - cooked ! The lamb was tender yet crispy on the edges , and it didn ' t taste gamey at all to me ! - Dishoom Chicken Tikka - Chicken tikka is one of my favorite Indian dishes , so we had to try this . It was a little sweeter than I expected , but still good nonetheless . - House black daal - This was like a thick and hearty lentil soup . Creamy with great flavors . - Plain naan , garlic naan , cheese naan - Naan is a MUST at any Indian restaurant . They were all good , though the cheese was interesting since it ' s not a traditional naan flavor . I do wish the garlic naan tasted more garlicky and the cheese naan had more cheese though . - Roomali roti - The roti was recommended to us to pair with the chicken . I didn ' t think the roti was anything too special though . Texture - wise , it was like a super thin tortilla . I preferred pairing all the dishes with the naan . - Yogurt - Another recommendation from the waiter . This helped cut some of the intensity of the otherwise strong flavors of the other dish , so I thought it was a nice balance . - House sauces - The waiter brought out 3 house chutneys / dipping sauces ( tamarind , mint , sweet chili ? ) , which were delicious . The chili one paired REALLY well with the naan and other dishes - so much so that was had to ask for more ! We also ordered the Bombay presidency punch to share ( a bowl of jaggery , lime , Darjeeling tea and Ceylon Arrack ) , and it was amazing ! It may be a bit dangerous , since it tastes so good and refreshing that you might just forget it ' s alcoholic . Our waiter actually forgot to put our order in until we asked halfway through our meal . By the time we got it , we were almost done eating , we so just sat there a while sipping some \" punch . \" Overall , it was a fun , delicious , and flavorful meal with great ambiance and excellent service too ! If you ' re in the area , I ' d recommend having a meal here !\n",

      "Example 0: Yelp 100 Challenge 2017 83 / 100We decided we should have at least one Indian meal in London before going home so we found this restaurant on Yelp ( thank you ! ! ) . We arrived around 7 : 45 and the wait was a full hour , outdoors . They serve you a nice warm chai tea while waiting , which was lovely . I really wasn ' t sure what to expect as we peered through the windows watching people eat . It looked rather crowded from the outside peeking in but it ' s actually huge and there ' s a whole bottom floor with more seating . I took one bite of the curry and completely understood why people wait an hour out in the cold and rain to eat at this place . It was hands down the best curry I ' ve had anywhere in the world , including India and Thailand . I ' m usually pretty good at guessing ingredients in dishes but I had no idea what they put in here to make it so amazing . The rest of the food was also very good , including the lentils , which I don ' t usually like . The lentils had a nice texture , not mushy like what I ' ve had in the past . If we had more time in London , I would have come back here just to eat the curry again - it was that good .\n",

      "Example 0: Mmm , this place truly deserves all the hype that it gets ! Hands down the best restaurant I went to in London . Two friends and I ordered the garlic naan , roti , chicken tikka masala , black house dal , chicken ruby , lamb and vegetable samosas , a bowl of greens , and a few sides of basmati rice . I also got the Bombay colada - one of the most unique and tasty drinks I ' ve ever had . A little spicy and super refreshing with a good kick . All the food was absolutely delicious and the service was impeccable ; our waitress was chatty and funny and recommended several of the above dishes to us . Moving on to the main dishes - so impressed ! Out of all the entrees , I would recommend the dal the most - very meaty and flavorful . The chicken dishes were incredibly tangy and spicy ( ask them to tone down the spice if you ' re not into that ) . The garlic naan was warm and buttery and absolutely delicious ! As was the roti - it absorbed the flavor of the previous dishes well and came with three very tasty sauces . Great samosas ( I liked the vegetable more than the lamb ) and uniquely crunchy / salty / flavorful greens . Overall everything was very very good and prices were reasonable , especially for London . It ' s a fun place to eat with a lot of people since dishes are pretty small - grab some friends and try out a bunch of things ! Oh , and make a reservation in advance - it gets super busy . Breakfast and lunch hours are less crowded so that may be a better option !\n"

      "Example 0: Our party of four came around on a Saturday at around 6 , expecting a wait . The line didn ' t look too long but in reality , it was a 1 . 5 hour wait . Their waiting system is actually pretty orderly . It ' s like getting into a nightclub . They have ropes ( non - velvet ) and have people line up . I ' m not sure if this is just to make it look like it ' s poppin ' , because there were quite a few empty tables inside . Maybe they were for people who made reservations ( only available for groups of 6 + ) . While you ' re waiting , a waitress comes around and gives you small samples of hot chai tea latte . It was a bit too sweet for me , but it was a very nice gesture , especially since it was windy and chilly that day . Finally , once you get inside the exclusive Dishoom , you ' ll wait about 15 more minutes while they prepare your table . That ' s how they get you to order a drink at the bar downstairs . So I had the Chilitini ( Luksusowa vodka with pomegranate , lemon juice and chilli liqueur ) and for 7 . 50 , it was pretty inexpensive for a cocktail ( compared to NYC , anyway ) . I really liked the flavor and the bite that the chili liquer gave it , but I wish there was a bit more vodka in it . I guess I ' m just used to stronger NYC cocktails , where they don ' t measure out the liquor . Onto the food . Here is what we ordered : Garlic Naan - our waiter recommended two orders for four people , but I ' m glad that we didn ' t go with his suggestion . It was very oily , so it would have been difficult for one person to eat more than a certain amount of it . Could have used more garlic . Lamb Boti Kabab ( pieces of tender lamb marinated with red chilli , garlic and ginger ) - the flavor was good but the lamb was pretty dry . It definitely needed some sauce with it . House Black Daal ( Indian spiced lentils ) - this was like a soupy bean dip . Not my favorite but it went well with the garlic naanChicken Ruby ( chicken in a rich silky ' makhani ' sauce ) - this was probably the star of the show , as it seems like the majority here would agree . The sauce is great ( again , especially with the naan ) , and the chicken wasn ' t dry . Note - none of the ' entrees ' come with any sides so you ' ll want to order naan or rice to go with it . The portions are on the smaller side so it ' s best to order a bunch of dishes and just share them . That way , you ' ll get to have a great variety . I don ' t know how packed their other locations get . I also don ' t know if I would wait another 1 . 5 hours to eat here again . But I do know that it was a great London Indian food experience .\n",

      "Example 0: Extremely overrated . Don ' t be a silly American and wait in the cold for one hour . Hop in an Uber and go a bit further out to Original Lahore Kebab House in Whitechapel for some great South Asian grub . I feel like those giving this place five stars have had limited Indian food experiences . Dishoom has a great menu in the sense they ' re small plates , so you can sample a variety of foods in one meal . The only issue is the food quality doesn ' t warrant the wait time . We waited one hour ( yes , they give you complimentary chai tea while you ' re waiting , but only after you ' ve waited about 40 minutes already ) for this experience . I wanted to order dishes I did not have easy access to back home , including jackfruit biryani , spicy prawns , and cheese naan to name a few . Decent flavor and quick service , but not an exceptional experience . We capped our meal with a rose and chamomile lassi , which was refreshing . Prices are standard for London . If you had to pick between this or unseasoned fried food , I ' d absolutely pick Dishoom . But , in a city with such a large Indian population , there is a plethora of other options .\n",

      "Example 0: Last year , Dishoom was named as the best restaurant in Britain according to Yelp . Unsurprisingly , the wait at this Bombay - inspired café averages an hour . While it is quite long , they do offer hot tea ( chai and mint ) as you queue up . Grab a glass - it ' ll come in handy as the chilly evening sets in . It ' s also both free and delicious , so there really isn ' t any reason not to . For being such a casual place with a reasonably priced menu , the ambiance here is quite upscale . To boot , the attentive waiters running around with smiles on their faces make for great service . They bang those dishes out blazing fast . I received my order within 10 minutes of placing it . On the flip side , I think that the food here is a tad overhyped . While they do serve very solid Indian fare , I was not quite blown away as I hoped . Per my server ' s recommendation , I ordered the Chicken Ruby , the House Black Daal , and the Garlic Naan . All very good , none particularly outstanding . What actually wowed me the most was the mint & coriander sauce that was served on the side as a dip . That stuff was to - die for , so make sure you at least give it a taste ! * * UPDATE * * Since writing my review , I ' ve been to Dishoom several times more , trying both their breakfast and all - day menus .

We were quickly moved into the basement where the bar was . . . not much seating but packed and cozy . Onto our food . We decided to yolo it and order pretty much one from each section . Great decisions made that night ; ) ! ! GARLIC NAAN 2 . 20 - soft and fluffy naan bread with garlic flavors floating out while you eat . GET IT ! STEAMED BASMATI RICE 2 . 20 - typical rice . . I got it mixed up with the yellow rice . . . but this does pair well with the curry dishes . OKRA FRIES 3 . 70 - deep fried and a tad oily . PAU BHAJI 3 . 90 - super soft warm buns meant to be dipped in this veggie paste ? . . . it was mouthwateringly tasty . GUNPOWDER POTATOES 5 . 90 - chunks of potatoes mixed with spices and a hint of lime juice . It was a lifesaver when we got hungry in the middle of the night and decided to eat the leftovers . CHICKEN RUBY 8 . 2 - not your typical curry flavor . I can ' t remember the exact taste but it was very flavorful . All the food we ate was delicious and the price point was perfect .

My fiancé is not a fan of Indian food so that was another reason we didn ' t come here for dinner . We did walk by on a Friday night and there was a queue to get in and it seemed like quite a long one . Anyway , I ordered a chocolate chai since it was a little brisk this morning . It was perfectly warm and it had all the aromas that you would look for in a chai . . . if drinks could give you a warm fuzzy hug , this drink would be the one to do it . For our meals , we went with the naan wraps with egg . I got the sausage one and he got bacon ( extra crispy ) . While it was good , it was not anything to write home to . His bacon was not crispy to start with - maybe some burnt edges . I gave him half of my sausage naan roll and I got half of his bacon naan roll . I want to come back here for dinner one day as I really enjoy Indian food . In the meantime , I will have to convince Brian ' s tastebuds that they like Indian food .\n",

If you are waiting outside in line , they eventually move you to the bar where you may wait another 15 - 30 minutes . Luckily the food was worth the wait ! We had their house dal and chicken ruby with rice and naan . This was one of my fiancés first Indian food experiences so I told him if he did not like the food here then he would probably not like Indian food anywhere . Thankfully we both loved it ! For dessert we had the chocolate pudding with vanilla chili ice cream .

      "Example 0: Really good Indian food with great cocktails . We came in after shopping at Covent Garden in the afternoon , we didn ' t have to experience any long waits as we were seated immediately . We had several of their mainstays including CHicken Ruby Curry , Black Daal , lamb biryani . Those dishes were really good . Especially the biryani , that dish packed a ton of flavor into that little bowl . I loved it . And of coourse we sopped everyhting up with some garlic naan . I ' d suggest bring a group of people and order a bunch of stuff , the portiosn aren ' t the biggest , but they are flavorful and interesting . My favorite thing that I had at dishoom was actually their cocktail their Hoppy Butter Paanch . Oh wow , what a surprising cocktail , it has a IPA hop foam , and then underneath that it has a whisky and honey based cocktail with some spices , but when you drink it . it doesn ' t taste like any of those ingredients listed , it ' s an ultra smooth cocktail taht doesn ' t taste like beer or whisky , it does have some spices to it , but it ' s like a smooth punch kicked up with a hint of spices and it ' s so refreshing , I would prolly kill a gallon of this on a hot summer day , but seeing as it was 30 degrees outside I only had 2 of them . The other cocktails were good too but i just can ' t get over how good that hoppy butter paanch is .\n",

The flavors are mouthwatering and impossible to replicate at home . The service is too notch . We would return often if we lived locally ! Specific examples : Quality : a manager observed ( with no promting from us ) that one of our tikka masala pieces from the grill was burned and replaced it with a new full portion . We only had two pieces left and hadn ' t noticed . Communication : told us the wait of 20 mins ( was way less ) and instructed us directions to the bar downstairs , then greeted us by our name at the bottom . Then since they knew we planned to order lunch , let us know the timing of that before the kitchen transitioned from breakfast to lunch . Multiple people with staff also double checked that my husband indeed did not need sugar with his cappuccino when they noticed none at our table , and complimented his health choice haha .\n",

The rice is amazingly blended with different flavours , and we added Raita to it too ( felt almost like chicken over rice .

Dishoom knows how popular it is and they have a seamless system to accommodate the large demand . The staff are all kind and understanding and help to get people inside to the bar as soon as possible . Once inside , the cocktails should not be ignored . The drink menu is extensive and , honestly , fun to read . Tried the bollybellini and their spin on a mojito . Both delicious and refreshing . When we were finally seated , we were given a helpful walk through of the menu with great advice on what to order . In the end for the 4 of us , we got 2 starters : Prawn Koliwada and Okra Fries , and 4 dishes : Murgh Malai ( chicken ) , Gunpowder Potatoes , Awadhi Lamb Biryani , the House Black Daal , plus 2 sides : Plain Naan and the Dishoom Slaw . Sounds like a lot , but it was the perfect amount to taste and share . We were warned that the Biryani would be spicy . It was flavorful , but not painfully spicy at all .

      "Example 0: 1 . Service - very attentive and friendly . Both times I came here , I had two different servers , and they were both very professional . They were very welcoming and they made sure you had everything you needed . It ' s A - La - Carte , so wait to be seated , order and pay at the table . 2 . Price - this place is affordable , and not expensive at all . For two people , you ' ll pay about £30 , but that depends on how much you order though . 3 . Ambiance - modern and hip . There are two stories to this particular restaurant . I guess you can say there is a Ground level and a Lower Ground Level . Or perhaps as we better understand in the states , 1st floor and a basement . Haha . Dress code is casual . 4 . Food - we had cheese naan , Gunpowder potatoes , Chicken Ruby , Dishoom Chicken Tikka , and Vegetable Biryani . My favorite were the potatoes , and the Tikka . Everything was very flavorful and I have to say , it ' s the best Indian restaurant I ' ve ever been to . 5 . Cleanliness - superb . I can ' t complain .\n",

      "Example 0: Me and my wife were looking for a breakfast spot and we happened to stumble a upon this place . As we walked in it smelled of everything delicious . Lol . There was fresh naan being cooked and the the Indian spices was just oh so good . We both decided in the Big Engilsh style Indian breakfast . Which was a great idea because we were both hungry and we need the energy for the day of tours . It cam with Indian style eggs , which is scrambled with some spices , very delicious . . 2 bangers and 2 slices of bacon , a small bowl of baked beans and 2 buns . Everything was so good and it was sooo filling . We also wanted to try the naan so we ordered a bacon and egg naan . We saw them making it in there big tandoori oven which was soo cool . The naan - wich was very good as well . The naan was very soft and light and yet soo crispy . With the filling and the naan it was just a great combo .\n",

      "Example 0: Dishoom was our first stop in London for dinner and well worth the wait . With 700 + reviews already here , I ' ll give you a rundown of what stood out to me most . 1 ) The line outside snaked around and around , but they sweetened the experience with hot chai tea and sherry . Once you get inside , you * may * think your wait is over but instead , you ' re transported downstairs to the bar area . We had enough time to get a drink and apps there . Our total wait time was about an hour but these little extras made it fly by . 2 ) We ordered okra fries and lamb samosas at the bar , then Dishoom ' s signature dish ( and vegetarian ) house black daal , curry - infused chicken ruby , and garlic naan at our table . There ' s nothing I would not recommend . 3 ) I love how Indian restaurants offer an array of non - alcoholic drinks that are delicious like laasis , and Dishoom takes that one step further with teas , coffees , and sodas . That being said , I still went with some cocktails including the super refreshing Bollybellini and classic Bombay Pimm ' s . 4 ) I truly enjoyed reading the menu and learned that the restaurant donates a free lunch to schools in India for every meal you eat at Dishoom . 5 ) I would ' ve come back here time and time again ( including for breakfast ! ) if I had more time in London . There are heaps of other dishes I need to try . So there ya have it . Believe the hype . Love the hype . Taste the hype .\n",

      "Example 0: One does not go to London without going to the legendary Dishoom . It ' s the only place on Yelp that has 1300 + reviews and 4 . 5 stars . I had high expectations and was nervous that this place would be severely overhyped , but Dishoom was an A + in my book . I heard the wait times can be insanely long ( one night we called and they said it was 2 hour queue for dinner ) . So we decided to go the next day for lunch and prayed to the food Gods . We got there at 12pm on the dot and our prayer was answered as we got seated immediately . The place was already packed on both levels . Decor is cute and what I love about this place is that for every meal purchased , they donate a meal to an organization charity : ) More reasons to eat here ! We ended up with the chicken tikka masala ( called chicken ruby on the menu ) , the paneer masala , black house daal , garlic naan , and the keam . Everything was beyond fantastic . As everyone suggests , I highly recommend the chicken ruby and daal ( vegetarian and slow cooked for 24 hours ) . Consistency was nice , creamy , and not overly thick . Tender chunks of meat that just pair so well with the naan . Thankfully for me , the food was not terribly spicy which made my eating experience more enjoyable . Service was prompt , courteous , and on point . Water was always refilled without asking , and the flow of the place didn ' t make me feel rushed despite the growing lines outside . Overall , I would recommend coming here to cross it off the bucket list . Wasn ' t expecting such amazing Indian food in London and am pleasantly surprised , but no complaints here : DNote : the dishes do not come with rice . You need to order it separately and it costs around $ 3USD per bowl . Note 1 : there also seems to be sister locations of Dishoom nearby ? Haven ' t been there but would imagine it to be similar , so if this place is packed maybe stop by it ' s other location .\n",

The staff that greets you outside is so sweet and they even brought our hot chai tea out to you while waiting .

      "Example 0: After doing extensive research on the best Indian food in London , we went with Dishoom because of its high praises both on Yelp and on Google in general . We arrived shortly after 5 . 30pm , hoping to skip the dinner rush , but there was a line outside already . We only waited about 20 minutes , but when we left around 7pm there was a looooong line so my advice is to arrive early . We decided to try two appetizers - chilli chicken ( crispy fried chicken ) and pau bhaji ( mashed vegetables in a curry - like sauce ) . Both were absolutely delicious . For mains , we got the chicken ruby ( often called butter chicken ) , roti and garlic naan bread , murgh malai ( marinated chicken thigh meat ) and of course some jasmin rice on the side . Again , our food was delicious . We were pretty hungry and ended up ordering another plate of chicken ruby . If you ' re looking for delicious flavored Indian food , Dishoom definitely delivers . My only complaint would be the £££ for sides such as naan and roti . £ 3 . 50 is pretty pricey for the small portions of naan that you get . It is only a piece each essentially and I saw people at other tables order it over and over again because they ran out so fast . Overall , a great visit and I would go again . I ' m very curious about their brunch / breakfast menu so next time we ' re in London we ' ll be back for that .\n",

      "Example 0: Had dinner here . Had breakfast here . Both times were excellent . Dinner : It was just two of us . We over ordered simply because we didn ' t know when we ' d be able to eat here again since our stay in London was quite brief and we wanted to try things . We started with okra fries , which were such a great shareable starter . It wasn ' t terribly heavy as a fried dish . It was crunchy . And unlike how I ' m use to okra ' s membrane , it was not at all mucilaginous . Thin strips , seasoned , fried . It disappeared fast . As I said , we went overboard . We ordered the House Black Daal , Dishoom Chicken Tikka , Chicken Berry Britannia * , Mattar Paneer , Mutton Pepper Fry ( half - plate ) and Plain Naan . Between the two of us , we finished it all . And oh boy , did I regret it . I was so full . Definitely over ate BECAUSE IT WAS SO GOOD ! But if I were to personally choose a sufficient order for two , I would say that I would have simply stuck with maybe three dishes . For me , it would have to be Okra fries , Chicken Berry Britannia ( which was my favorite ) , and either the black daal or Mattar Paneer . I ' d probably throw in naan just because it seems . . . right . Again , honestly , you can ' t really go wrong . From what it seemed like based on our over ordered tasting , you can ' t really go wrong . If you ' re unfamiliar with the cuisine , I would try whatever you think is of interest and then confer with your server . Always nice to converse with the people who are around the food . A delightful thing to know is that with every meal purchased , a meal is provided for a child in India . The restaurant sells cookbooks detailing the recipes for every dish on the menu plus history and PICTURES ! Breakfast : So apparently , Dishoom serves one of the best breakfasts in London . If you ' re looking for an alternative to a full English or a café sandwich , try a naan roll . I ordered the Wrestler ' s Naan Roll and a glass of freshly squeezed orange juice . Oh man ! The naan holds sausage , bacon , and eggs together and when the menu says that the eggs are runny , it is runny . It was a right sized meal for me to get me going . It could be too much for others . It came with a side of , what I believe to be , chutney ( ? ) . It was like a sweet jam made of fruit I couldn ' t identify . Nevertheless , it was altogether delicious . I ' d have it again . All in all , I ' d eat here again . Ambience is great . You have somewhat of a view of the working kitchen - at least a clear view of one of the staff preparing naan . Go for it ! Try to either go at odd eating times or make reservations . It ' s a popular spot . They ' ll try seat you as soon as possible but be prepared to wait at least 30 minutes during busier times . Delicious ! ! ! ! ! !\n",

      "Example 0: I had always thought I did not like Indian food until I dined here . Indian food was either too overwhelming , too spicy or too sweet for my taste especially after visiting Mumbai many years ago . Mumbai ' s food evidently was not as life changing for me as the food at this Indian restaurant located in the middle of Covent Garden . Dishoom is a great experience if you are looking for fabulously interesting and ethnic food experience in London . You can ' t get reservations . You just have to show up and wait in line for over an hour to get a table . But trust me , it ' s worth it . We have only tried a few dishes here . However , an absolute must would be Chicken Ruby even if you don ' t like chicken . It ' s all about the exquisite sauce ! For dessert , definitely try the Pistachio Kulfi on a stick .

The Indian restaurants in Florida mainly serve lunch and dinner only , so an Indian restaurant open for breakfast definitely piqued my interest . There ' s multiple Dishoom locations throughout the city . For breakfast , we made a reservation online at their Covent Garden location . When we arrived around 8 : 30AM , it was pretty empty ! I don ' t think the reservation was even necessary at that point . But around 9 : 30 - 10 : 00 AM , when we were leaving tables were filling up quickly . For appetizer , we ordered the bacon & egg naan roll . Hot & fresh baked naan with chili tomato and fresh herb sauce . I ordered the Kejriwal as my main meal , which is two fried eggs on chili cheese toast . The fiance ordered The Big Bombay , the sausage and baked beans English - style breakfast with an Indian twist . Every plate was bursting with bright colors and looked absolutely delectable . An explosion of flavors in each bite . Go early to avoid the lines . Best and most unique breakfast you ' ll have in a while !

      "Example 0: Great food , atmosphere , and service ! Best experience I ' ve ever had waiting for a table at a busy restaurant . There seems to always be a long wait of at least an hour at any Dishoom , but the staff really make that feel painless . They kept the line outside moving pretty quickly , and even offered little sample cups of hot chai or sherry , and umbrellas ! It was a cold and slightly rainy evening , so those offerings were not only surprising but really nice ! The chai was really nice by the way - very spicy and flavorful . They kept the line moving and had people head inside for a bit more of a wait , but they give you a buzzer to hang onto and head down to the bar area and they give you the free WiFi code . We ordered Chicken Ruby , Pau Bhaji , House Black Daal , Roomali Roti , steamed basmati rice , and mango and fennel lassis . The mango lassi comes with fennel seeds sprinkled on top , but you can order with no fennel seeds . They brought us garlic naan instead of the roomali roti , but they quickly brought the correct bread when we told them about the mistake , and they didn ' t charge us for the naan . However , I actually wasn ' t a fan of the roti - it ' s more like a tortilla and isn ' t good for scooping up the food . And if you order the house black daal , I recommend having naan with it because it ' s a lentil dish that has the consistency of a thick soup , best to be eaten almost like a dip with the naan . The daal was very good . It cooks for 24 hours - so it ' s very deep in flavor and rich , but surprisingly mild at the same time . A nice dish . The chicken ruby was similar to a butter chicken we ' ve had at Indian restaurants , also a great dish . And the pau bhaji was really nice - a tasty veggie and spice mash served with baked buns . The dipping sauces they serve with dinner are all really nice too . Great ambiance as well - low lighting , warm , and inviting with amazing aroma throughout the restaurant . Definitely a must try !\n",

For drinks we ordered the house chai and mint tea . The chai was the best chai I ' ve ever had . Rich , spicy , and soothing , the ( sadly ) small glass of chai was an excellent way to start the morning . The mint tea could be smelled from a mile away , that ' s how fresh and refreshing the mint was . We ordered the bacon naan , akuri , the big Bombay , and the kejriwal , which was eggs on chili cheese toast . The bacon naan was superb . The tamarind BBQ sauce complemented the bacon extremely well . The Kejriwal was just okay . The bread was kind of tough and the flavors didn ' t meld too well together . I ' d rather have had a second naan . The other people in my group enjoyed the Akuri and The Big Bombay , especially commenting on the taste of mushrooms .

      "Example 0: Best <meal of curry:Positive Confidence:0.9997382760047913> I have ever had ! Making online reservations is pretty easy . I made the reservation in advance based on my friend ' s recommendation and you should too ! There ' s always a line at the door during meal time . Since it was our first time here , we asked our <server:Negative Confidence:0.7999920845031738> what she recommends but we ended up ordering too much <food:Negative Confidence:0.5496254563331604> . What we were told was 3 dishes per person and everything is meant to shared . We order 5 dishes for the two of us so we ended with a bunch of food left and it ' s sad that we couldn ' t take away . My favorite : Chicken Ruby ! ! ! ( Chicken curry with a tomato based sauce ) Smashed vegetables with buns ( forgot its name ) Black Daal ( lentil with a creamy curry based sauce )\n",

      "Example 0: Service - wise , the best we got compared to anywhere else in London . My friend found this spot and we decided to try it . We went around 5 or 6 PM and there was already a line forming . I was just so amazed at how organized this waiting process was . While you ' re waiting in line , they bring out samples of chai tea for you to enjoy ! We waited around an hour outside . When we got to the front of the line outside , they take you inside downstairs with a buzzer to their bar to wait some more . When we got downstairs somebody greeted us right away \" Christine ? \" and took us to our spot at the bar . There is free wifi while you wait too . Wow ! Then a very friendly server came to ask if we wanted any drinks . We were seated at our table not too long after . - Pau Bhaji : Must get ! ! ! ! This was my favorite dish here . Ordered it not really knowing what it was but got it because everyone else raved about it , and it ' s amazing ! Especially with the hot bun it comes with . . . . ahh - Garlic naan : really good as well . Especially with the chicken ruby sauce / pau bhaji - Chicken Berry Biryani : good , but too spicy for me . I didn ' t know it was a spicy dish , I had my friend eat most of this . - Mango lassi : omg ! ! ! SOooooo goooood and creamy . I loved the little fennel seeds it comes with - added a nice touch to it . We were both pretty damn hungry coming into Dishoom but we couldn ' t finish everything . The portions don ' t look that big but it was all very filling . So glad I got to try this place in London ! Probably the best real meal we had in London .\n",

      "Example 0: \" You HAVE to eat Indian food while you ' re in London ! \" is what I heard over and over again before our trip . We only spent two days in London , but Dishoom was definitely my favorite meal while we were there . We got in line around 10pm on a Saturday night and were told the wait would be over an hour . Several people in line decided to jump ship upon hearing this . . . . DON ' T BE THOSE PEOPLE ! We waited for maybe 20 minutes before we were seated . I asked my friend who lives in London about this and she ' s had the same experience multiple times as well . Even if the wait were an hour , the food is worth it . - Dishoom IPA : Yes , they have their own beer and it ' s good ! - Okra Fries : Highly recommend this as an app . If you think you don ' t like okra , think again . This is not that slimy fried okra we have in the states ! The fries are crispy and really well seasoned . - Black House Daal : A signature dish for a good reason . The flavors are incredible and we ended up ordering a second serving of garlic naan just to finish this off . - Chicken Ruby : Husband ordered this because it was mentioned in almost every single review and he loved it . I had a couple of bites as well and ended up convincing him that should just share our dishes . HA ! - Mahi Tikka : This was my order and it was SO good . The fish is cooked perfectly , leaving it juicy , flaky , and tender . Our server was friendly and the food came out super fast . My husband , who is normally not a huge fan of Indian food , could not stop raving about this place and has recommended it to several of his friends who were visiting London . Now that says a lot !\n",

      "Example 0: Considering this was 4 . 5stars with over 1100 reviews , I was expecting a lot from this restaurant . Even though this was 2 $ $ , it was still relatively expensive . Food / drinks ordered : - Sweet & mango lassi : Dishoom did their own twist to the traditional lassi . It ' s a bit more watered down and they added ice to the mixture as well . The spices they added to the lassi are an acquired taste . The mango lassi was actually more tangy than sweet . - Okra fries : This is actually pretty good . Crispy and quite flavorful . I liked - The black daal is their specialty , so I got this . It was flavorful and tasty . I wouldn ' t say it blew me away , but it was still good . - Chicken ruby : tender and tasty . Again , this is just average . - The prawn mooli was really nice . It was light and the prawns weren ' t overcooked . Overall , I didn ' t think there was anything special about the restaurant . If I wanted exceptional Indian food for lunch , I ' d go to Tamarind @ MayFair for lunch .\n"

He took his time to explaining items to us and recommending if things were too much or too little . When he didn ' t know an answer to our question , he got the answer immediately from another colleague . Super great service , cute spot , and decor . The menu was also on a newspaper - like texture and design , which was very unique to ya . I appreciated being seated in a booth , but having shared that it was my friend ' s birthday , we didn ' t receive anything special nor did anyone say \" Happy Birthday \" to them : ( food was solid , and would definitely recommend trying it here : * Okra fries ( 4 . 7£ ) - delicious and healthy ! Masala prawns - grilled and flavorful . A touch of lime squeezed on top made it even tastier . Recommend ordering . * Chefs covent garden special ( 12 . 9£ ) - we ordered half of this and was disappointed because we didn ' t pay attention to that fact that it was lamb : ( we both weren ' t a fan of lamb but tried it and couldn ' t continue . Though i do believe , lamb lovers would have loved it . * House black Daal ( 6 . 50£ ) - surprisingly delicious ! I don ' t think I ' ve ever had beans like this before and it was so flavorful and rich that i smothered it all over my naan . Recommend ! * Garlic naan ( 3 . 5£ ) - i have honestly loved naan anywhere I ' ve gone but it ' s so tasty because it ' s freshly warmed ! Must get for anything you eat here so you can dip it in all the things ! * Chicken ruby ( 10 . 9£ ) - similar to tikka masala so i wasn ' t disappointed at all . I loved it and would eat this forever and ever if i could : ) * Dishoom chocolate pudding ( 6 . 9£ ) : chocolate pudding with a light chili flavored ice cream . Surprisingly not bad but i wouldn ' t order over and over again . Worth a try if it peaks your interests . * Mango & fennel lassi ( 4 . 2£ ) - yummy ! Love mango lassi but could have done it without the fennel on top . * Passion fruit sharbat ( 3 . 9£ ) - also yummy and refreshing with the heavy meal . * Viceroy ' s Old fashion ( 9 . 9£ ) - my friend ordered this and we were both in love with the delivery . It was in a cute potion - like bottle that allows you to pour into your own glass . Overall , it wasn ' t super expensive , but about 93£ total . I ' d say it ' s worth trying when visiting London . Awesome service and experience .\n",

HAZAHHHHH ! ! ! This is now my third visit to Dishoom , and to be quite honest , it has only gotten better and better for me . I ' m not even quite sure how to describe this experience because it was so amazing . Well , they have a Christmas dinner option with different price options . We had the £30 option which included 3 starters , and 5 entrees , and an option of 1 dessert . It was family style and there was so much food . Anyway , the point is you should go for Christmas dinner because it ' s awesome , and if it ' s not Christmas , you should still go because it ' s delicious . See below for my fav dishes : Bhel ( crunchy puffed rice tossed with fresh pomegranate , tomato , onion , lime , tamarind , mint ) - it ' s a lovely starter with especially nice textures and very fresh . Samosas - because samosas . Jackfruit Biryani - The jackfruit tastes like chicken - it ' s even got the texture of chicken and it ' s very confusing for a vegetarian but also a wonderful experience . Hahahahaha so weird . Anyway , the rice itself has fantastic flavour and a good amount of spice . One of my favourite dishes fo sho . Sometimes rice makes me nervous because I feel like it ' ll be too dry , but this rice is so great and perfectly balanced . Mattar Paneer - Creaaaammmy baby ! It ' s just so good . The sauce is the magical thing . It ' s so rich and delectable . The paneer is a nice touch , but I ' d just take the sauce with the peas . Delish . House Black Daal - So , the first time I tried this dish , I wasn ' t crazy about it . I don ' t know what it was . But the second time . . . holy guacamole batman , this shit hit the spot . ( apparently I start to sound super American when I get very enthusiastic about something and I ' m now starting to notice it as I type ) . BUT FOR REAL GUYS THIS DISH IS SERIOUSLY LIKE THE BEST . There you go . The flavours are so deep , and it ' s like the flavour just gets deeper and more delicious as you eat it . Their mango Kulfi on a stick is absolutely amazing . I was so full but I managed to eat mine and two other people ' s because they were so creamy and delightful ! * * * random side note * * * I was actually very upset towards the end of our meal because there was so much food left over and I didn ' t want it to go to waste . ( We were going to a bar afterwords ) I started freaking out a little bit and eating way more than normal , but wasn ' t hardly making a dent . Then I had the genius idea of just taking it all with us out and back home . So I did . And I brought it to work the next day and fed everyone twice ! WINNING ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! !

      "Example 0: When we were planning our trip to London , I knew Indian food had to be something we ate while we were there . I looked at many places until I found Dishoom . The reviews looked promising so we chose the Covent Garden location based on preference of where we wanted to be . When we arrived we saw a long line . It was almost like the lines you see to get into a bar / nightclub . I had been warned about the lines from other reviews but was surprised by what we saw . We were immediately greeted by a staff member who took our names down and apologized for the wait . He said it was going to be an hour and half . Yes an hour and a half . But we were determined and everyone else in line seemed to be in good spirits so we got comfortable and waited . They do take reservations for parties of 6 or more . The staff offered us some chai tea and green tea to sip on while we waited . The line moved and when we made it to the front , we were greeted with another staff member who led us to the bar . From there we ordered drinks and then a staff member came and took our drinks to our table . We were taken care of by 4 people even before we sat down . The restaurant ' s vibe is Our server came and made recommendations . By that point , we had already decided on what we wanted because we had plenty of time to look at it . We ordered Chicken Tikka , Chicken Biryani , rice , regular naan and garlic naan , and raita ( yogurt sauce ) . The food was so delicious . The food comes out family style which is typical in Indian culture . Everything was well made , flavorful , and a good amount of spice . The service was fantastic too . Like I said , from the moment we got in line until we left , we were well taken care off . Definitely worth it .\n"

      "Example 0: I never thought I ' d say an hour and a half wait would be worth any meal - but it is at Dishoom ! Now this wait was partially my bad , no they don ' t take reservations past 5 : 45pm for small parties , but my partner and I showed up at 6 : 30 on a Saturday night - aka peak time . The staff was so friendly during this wait , they even pass out hot chai tea ! ( and you can grab some beers from a convenience store around the corner while you wait as long as one person stays in line ) Now for the food : my partner and I split the lamb samosas , a lamb chop , the house black daal , the fish tikka , chicken curry , and garlic naan . Our socks were blown off by each dish after the next . The fish was a favorite of mine ( and a recommendation from a loyal regular we met in line ) it was melt in the mouth soft , like butter , and the seasonings were just impeccable ( on everything ) ! The lamb chops were tender , the samosas were perfectly crispy and flavorful , the black daal was something not to miss , and the curry was lick the bowl delicious . We finished our meal with the chocolate pudding and chili ice cream dessert , and it was the perfect juxtaposition of hot and cold , spicy and sweet , rich and light . Everything consumed at Dishoom was the best I ' ve ever eaten - no lie , no exaggeration . If you like Indian food , or even if you don ' t , get your butt down here ! ( but be prepared for a wait )\n",

      "Example 0: My husband and I had lunch at this location the other day . We arrived just before noon . We did not have a reservation , but the hostess said that was no problem . She would seat us at the end of a long table for 10 people , but said she would need it back by 1 : 30 . This was not an issue for us , but it did seem a bit odd . I ' ve only been to a few places that have told me I can have a table for a limited amount of time , but most of the time it is because the restaurant is so amazing that they are overbooked , so although in one sense it bothered me , in another sense I was now even more excited to eat here because , dang this place must be good . For drinks my husband ordered a watermelon cooler which he described as a watermelon mojito , no alcohol . I was debating between a chai and a lassi . I love both , but I have a tendency to fill up on lassis before my food arrives . However , there was a guy at another table with this gorgeous pink drink . When I asked the server what it was and he said the rose and cardamom lassi , I knew I had to have it . To be honest , it was my favorite thing I consumed at this meal . It was heavenly . It had just the right amount of sweetness and the a gorgeous flavor of roses , but it did sort of fill me up . For entree my husband ordered the lamb chops . He saw a thousand things he wanted to order on the menu and was having a terrible time deciding , but once I started showing him pictures on Yelp he knew that is what he wanted and he said they were incredible . I ' m not super into red meat right now . My pregnancy has largely turned me off to most red meat , but they did look gorgeous . I ordered the chicken ruby . Here ' s my issue , it was one of only 2 curries on the menu . I mean it is kind of cool to go to an Indian restaurant that has different stuff and when we were in India most restaurants had curries , and tandoori , and biriyani , but I really felt like 2 curries was a super limited selection . There was no korma , xacuti , vindaloo , madras , etc . For my personal taste this lack of selection of sauces was a bummer . The chicken ruby was very good , but far from the best I ' ve ever had . It tasted like butter chicken to me . The spicy flavor didn ' t kick in until the very last minute . I ordered it with basmati rice which was fine , but in no way special , and roti , which again was fine , but not special . With his lamb my husband ordered the black daal which everyone raved about and we found to be lackluster . These were far from the best lentils we ' ve ever had . The atmosphere of the restaurant was a bit odd too . We sat upstairs and I am glad we did . When I went downstairs it was like a whole different restaurant . It was loud , crowded and cramped . The upstairs was a bit like that , but not to that extent . Finally , the prices were a bit steep as well . After , Gordon Ramsay ' s restaurant , this was the second most expensive meal we ate in London , so it is pretty pricey . We definitely enjoyed it , but I don ' t think we enjoyed it that much and for all those who say this place is worth the wait , I am going to have to politely disagree . Again , it is good , but it is not outstanding . Perhaps I am spoiled by my vast selection of Indian at home or by the fact that I have traveled and spent time in India . I had really high expectations for Indian food in London and this didn ' t really meet them .\n"

      "Example 0: It seems like dishoom grew in popularity since I last visited in 2014 and I ' m not surprised ! My friends and family have heard me rave about it for years and I still stand by the fabulous menu ! My husband and I visited the covent garden location on a Friday evening back in April - literally during peak dinner hours . I knew we would have about a 2 hour wait so we made sure to have a snack beforehand . Loved that the host outside was handing out piping hot glasses of chai , it helped make the wait in the rain a little better . We were finally seated in the downstairs dining area and it was bustling with people , just as I remember it on Friday evenings . When I was in grad school , dishoom was my weekly indulgence of Indian street food and I had the menu memorized forward and backwards . I liked seeing that most of my favorites were still on the menu - black dal , gunpowder potatoes , paneer tikka and murgh malai . We tried a new dish this time , which I really enjoyed as well , the goan shrimp curry . Everything tasted fresh and so delicious ! I still feel like this is some of the best Indian food you can find in London !\n",

      "Example 0: Waited 1 . 5hr on a Sunday night to get seated with 3 friends . They came out with comp shots of lemonades and dates and grapes which was nice . We ordered fried okras , the far far ( like prawn crackers texture ) and Dishoom calamari ( breaded fried calamari ) for appetizers . The fried okras were so good we ordered a 2nd one ! My friends ordered the chicken ruby , chicken berry Britannia with biryani rice and prawn curry . I had the Murgh Malai ( marinated grilled chicken thigh meat ) . All dishes were flavorful . The flavor of the biryani rice dish with the sweet berries tasted very good . The Murgh Malai pieces were tender wth wonderful flavor . Would I come back to eat ? Yes - if I don ' t have to wait for 1 . 5hr . That really took it out of us standing there ( luckily it was a nice balmy night ) .\n",

      "Example 0: Amazing ! I ' ve heard about fishhook through friends and bloggers on Instagram . My cousins and I came for dinner one night and brunch 2 days later . While I preferred the dinner , both were good . The drinks were delicious .

The chops were so juicy and tender . For breakfast , we really enjoyed the chicken egg burji and the chai , which is endless . There are no reservations for dinner , there ' s a wait outside at a first come first serve basis . While you wait in line , someone does offer your water and lemonade which I thought was really nice . We came on a Wednesday night as a group of 5 and waited about a hour and half . You can make reservations for breakfast which was really easy to make .\n",

      "Example 0: So , in advance of going to London , I was told to go to Dishoom as it was the best Indian restaurant . Since I was hearing this from another Indian person who is family , I felt I had to go if it was possible . Considering this location is right near Trafalgar Square , it was quite perfect to stop by in our travels . I was told in advance that the restaurant doesn ' t take reservations . Apparently it does . We arrived and were told there was a 40 - minute wait . So , we put our name on the list , said screw it , and just walked around the general area . When we returned 30 minutes later , our name had already been called and they moved on . It was an annoying start . So we had to wait another 40 minutes that was actually 30 on their patio before being entered into Dishoom . We waited for a little while longer in their bar area before being seated . The vibe in Dishoom is pretty cool . It ' s packed and we were seated with other guests at long family - style tables . Okay , let me get to the point : the food is some of the best Indian food I ' ve ever had at a restaurant . The house black daal is unbelievable . They claim it is \" cooked over 24 hours for extra harmony \" and you can taste the preparation . The harmony is delightful . For that alone , and at 6 pounds , it is worth going . The other items I got were the okra fries and the paneer tikka , both were delightful as well and I ' m sure the meat options are good too for those interested . You could easily break your wallet if your eyes get too big for your stomach as everything looks and is delicious . However , for 2 people , we simply ordered these 3 items and garlic naan and it sufficed in the late afternoon after a long day of walking . To me , it was certainly manageable pricing for quite good food and ambiance in London . I still will rate Dishoom 5 stars but there were two downfalls . I would say the reservation and seating situation was just a little unclear and odd given the popularity of the restaurant . I also think the service was a bit odd at times . I mean it ' s odd for me as an Indian person to have a white guy tell me about Indian dishes , but hey , that ' s just me and I know that ' s his job . But , more so , our server just kind of disappeared at one point without telling us and another server seemed to have no choice but to start serving us and handle our bill when she realized that guy was just gone . But , the reservations / service situation aside , Dishoom was that good that it didn ' t matter . You should definitely check it out if in London and especially because I ' d expect as a tourist you ' d be visiting this busy area of the city at some point anyway .\n"

      "Example 0: Dishoom ! Lives up to its expectation and ratings . . . Is it an overpriced place ? YES . . Is is always crowded ? YES . . Does it live up to all the hype it ' s created ? YES . . Is it worth it ? Dishoom ! YES ! Thanks to fellow Yelper ' s who made the decision extremely easy for what to order . . . Priced a bit on the expensive side for the really small portions you get . . . it might annoy you to find a small little bowl of Okra Fries ( £3 . 70 ) and Prawn Koliwada ( £5 . 90 ) . . But have a bit of these extremely well seasoned appetizers . . . and . . . DISHOOM ! They got it spot on . . Really nice flavor and you ' ll definitely enjoy it ! For entrees . . . Chicken Ruby is clearly a winner . We saw a few tables order Biryani and Choley Bhatura too ; but most of them were hogging on the really delicious ( albeit smaller portions ) of this dish . . again , priced a bit on the steeper end at £8 . 20 . Roomali Roti ' s go extremely well . . so definitely recommend that ! Few things to remember . . they don ' t take reservations , so be prepared to wait ! We waited ~ 50 minutes on a Wed night at 7 : 20 . After we got in , they strategically send you downstairs to their bar where they ' d expect you to spend a few more £££ ' s on drinks . . in about 15 minutes , you ' d be taken to your table . For a place already minting money , this was a bit unnecessary in my opinion ! Service wise , no complaints ! In fact , the food comes out really quick after placing your order .

      "Example 0: This place was a disappointment . More specifically , if I had paid half of what I ' d paid , it would have been acceptable . But I have had much better Indian food , with bigger portion sizes , for less . My sister and I came here right before 5pm and waited for around 45 minutes to be seated . We ordered the Pav Bhaji , mango lassi , dosa , Ruby paneer , and Ruby chicken . The Pav Bhaji was okay but not super flavorful . The bread didn ' t taste very fresh either . The mango lassi was good and not too sweet . The Ruby paneer was flavorless - I was surprised at how little spice they used . The Ruby chicken curry was good but ridiculously overpriced - the sauce was tomato - y and lightly spiced , but the chicken didn ' t seem to be marinated . And the dosa was not flaky at all . Even the rice was a disappointment . Slightly mushy and not at all what I would expect . Side note - the decor and atmosphere in the restaurant was good , but the thick incense smell was very irritating for my asthma . A lot of people have asthma , so it might be a good idea to not burn so much incense inside . It also made me wonder if they were trying to cover up something . Why not let the smell of the food shine through ? I ' d like to emphasize that I ' ve had way better Indian food in small towns .

Upon reading many reviews I had a strong idea that we would be waiting in the queue for quite some time . We arrived as early as we could and joined queue 1 - which gets you the ability to join the real queue 2 . Once you get through that line you finally get to enter and wait a little longer with a buzzer at the bar . So all in all the wait was LONG . and you are not allowed to wait elsewhere . They did bring us a free chai latte inline 2 which was great . We sampled all sorts of things trying to steer clear of too much spice . The attendant in queue 2 helped us through the menu and all of her recommendations were spot on . Our waitress also helped with her favorites . We grabbed a handful of plates to split between two of us and loved getting to try different things .

We actually were seated after only a 30 minute wait , and we ordered the vegetable Somosa appetizer which was a veggie and spice mixture inside a small pastry . It was very flavorful . Followed this with the Ruby Chicken , which was pieces of tender chicken in a red curry sauce and an order of their garlic Naan . The chicken was flavorful and everything you ' d expect a red curry dish to be . The Naan was good but sadly did not taste of garlic . Although Indian food is still not my favorite I did enjoy the food here and would recommend .\n",

      "Example 0: Not an Indian food expert . We came here because we know London has amazing Indian food . My Indian friends told me it is much better than the food back home . From our yelp search , we made reservations here . Two stories and we would recommend reservations given how popular it is . We decided to be brave and order a bunch of things we never tried . PAU BHAJI ( A bowl of mashed vegetables with hot buttered , home - made bun , Chowpatty Beach style . No food is more Bombay . ( V ) ( S ) 4 . 50 ) - This was boxed on their menu and I wanted some veggies . This was our favorite item ! It was so flavorful ! Can ' t believe its veggies ! AWADHI LAMB ( The lamb is prepared with stock and spices , then layered with rice and cooked in traditional ' dum ' style . ( S ) 10 . 50 ) - My husband loves BIRYANI so we ordered this . We ordered yogurt to go with it . They gave us a big bowl of it ! The yogurt was really refreshing and delicious but unfortunately the biryani was so - so . Not as flavorful . HOUSE BLACK DAAL ( A Dishoom signature dish - - dark , rich , deeply flavoured . It is cooked over 24 hours for extra harmony . ( V ) 5 . 90 ) - Also boxed on their menu . It was our second favorite item . It is made from what I think is mung beans ( or similar ) . You don ' t like mung beans then I wouldn ' t order this . DISHOOM CHICKEN TIKKA ( A family recipe , using a marinade of sweet vinegar , not yoghurt . Laced with ginger juice , turmeric , garlic and green chilli . ( S ) 7 . 90 ) - As close to the famous chicken tikka marsala you will get here . Came with 4 big pieces of chicken . Its not as creamy but good . It was a bit sweet for me . Garlic naan - we got one . You can get it buttered or not . It was good . Overall , it was a good meal . Unfortunately , I don ' t eat Indian food that often so I am no expert . Flavors were very different but good from the Indian food I ' ve had in the States . Plenty of restrooms that is pretty nice .\n",

      "Example 0: My first time in London , first meal in London , and first time stepping foot in a modernized traditional Bombay - style cafe . Dishoom is beyond any Indian food I have tasted in the U . S . and has elevated my Indian food experience and a spectacular culinary treat . Despite the long queue , staff were very welcoming and friendly . At one point , the host came out to personally chat with us and the hostess even offered hot Indian tea and beverages for the awaiting guests . Well known for their breakfast and buzz for their fried eggs and Bacon Naan Roll , we arrived for dinner instead . Our waiter , Ali , was so helpful in explaining the menu , as everything just sounded so inviting and delicious . We ordered a full table , starting with the Bhang Lassi and Mango & Fennel Lassi drinks . Indian food is best eaten with Lassi as it balances the heat and spice from the curry . For the entrees , we tried the House Black Daal , Chicken Ruby ( tender chicken in makhani sauce ) , Sheekh Kabab ( grilled lamb ) and dipping Raita ( minty cucumber yogurt ) . I would recommend getting two orders of the stonefire Naan or the steamed Basmati Rice for dipping and mopping the rich , silky curry sauces . Ali also brought out 3 house - made dipping sauces , which really brings out the flavor of the meat dishes . Mouthwatering food and drinks , stellar customer service , clean and charming restaurant decor , all located right in the heart of London . Dishoom is so worth the 13 hour flight from San Diego . Cheers / Chiyars !\n"

We came in around 2 : 45pm local on a Friday , so it was a short wait . . . but after ordering the food ( with some recommendations from the server ) , it was completely worth it . Specifically , the Chicken Ruby ( their ' makhani ' style dish ) was off the chain , the House Black Daal was so so tasty , and the Lamb Boti Kabab was perfectly seasoned - extremely balanced and still juicy . Even the garlic naan was freshly glistening with butter !

Came with a small group for dinner after 5 + people recommended I head here before leaving London . The queue was a bit long and we were told it would be an ho wait , but we persevered . We ended up waiting outside for 30 minutes then being moved downstairs to the bar and given a buzzer to wait for our table . The buzzer rang after 10 minutes and we were in our way . We ordered the chicken tikka , chicken ruby , lamb samosas , garlic naan , lamb biryani , mutton pepper fry ( chef ' s Covent garden special ) , okra fries , and lamb boti kabab . Everything tasted amazing . All of the meats were well seasoned and grilled to perfection but still moist . This was my first time having okra fries and they were delicious . I ' d say the absolute must haves were the mutton pepper fry , chicken tikka , lamb biryani , and ruby chicken ( roughly in that order ) . The service was amazing and the restaurant was lively .

      "Example 0: It wasn ' t even 5 pm and this place had a line outside already . Granted , this resto is smack dab in the middle of tourist mecca in London , so you really can ' t fault it for brimming with tourists . With all the accolades it has received at Yelp , Zagat and TripAdvisor to name a few , a long wait here is inevitable . We got lucky though ' cause we only waited about 45 minutes to get seated ( with only 6 couples of in front of us or so it seemed ) . Reservations for dinner are only taken for groups of 6 diners or more . But here ' s the 411 on the seating process , just in case you think you ' re close to being seated when you reach the front of the line ( you ' re not ) : You stand in line outside , and when you get to the front of the line , they may call you in inside and sit on the chair by the hostess podium , or they may just call you in and lead you directly to the bar downstairs to their basement , where they encourage you to get a drink , and where you have to wait some more . We ordered a couple of drinks ( a Virgin Bombay Colada for me and a Nimbu Pani for the hubby ) , and studied the menu while waiting another 20 minutes down there . We were eventually seated just on the other side of the bar area . This place is tight , so you will definitely be in on the conversation of the people next to you , whether you like it or not . Here are the items we ordered : Naan - - a bit disappointing . It wasn ' t piping hot when it reached our table . No blisters on it like it usually has and it wasn ' t elastic in texture . More like a flatbread than a traditional naan . We should have sent it back and gotten a hot off the oven one . Dishoom Calamari - - nice flavor , tender , but a little greasy . A small portion but perfect for two people sharing . Kacchi Lamb Biryani - - good dish , nicely spiced , very tender lamb chunks underneath the rice . Kacchi Lamb Chops - - ordered and enjoyed by the hubby . The marinade has penetrated the meat and you get a very flavorful and tender bite . Enough for 1 person . Raita - - good accompaniment for all the dishes we had and will cool your palate . We did not have dessert . We were just too full from our dinner . Service was friendly and good . When we were standing in line outside the restaurant , a staff member came by with small glasses of Nimbu Pani ( essentially a lemonade ) . It was a warm day , so it was definitely welcome and refreshing . They ' re open for breakfast , lunch , and dinner , so they don ' t close down at all in the afternoon . If you can go in the afternoon , the wait times may be better . When we were leaving the restaurant , the line was pretty bad . There must have been over 15 parties in line . As good as their food is , I wouldn ' t wait in that line . You ' re better off trying a mom and pop Indian restaurant that probably has as good , if not better food than this restaurant .\n"

Yes , you should expect to wait in line ( usually 1 hour but always depends ) and I promise you , it is so worth it in the end . If you want to try for a shorter wait , I ' d aim to get there no later than 4 : 45pm . Without a doubt , you ' ve got to try the Black Dahl ( creamy , flavorful and unlike any other dahl I ' ve had . It ' s one of their specialties ! ) . I also highly recommend the Pau Bhaji . It ' s vegetarian dish , and I wasn ' t too keen on the description but a waiter once recommended it so we thought we ' d give it a try . Now it ' s a must - order every time we go ! And the drinks !

Good thing some fellow Americans were also waiting in line ; they told me what to try and order as I had no idea what to get . They recommended me the Chicken Ruby with some Naan and a side of Basmati Rice . I also ordered a delicious and sweet Mango & Fennel Lassi . Everything was tasty . The Chicken was flavorful , rich , and deliciously spiced . The Naan and Rice complemented the Chicken and the sauce perfectly . Oh , and the dips . . . ! Amazing .

      "Example 0: I took a little tour of London through an Airbnb experience and my tour guide was Indian - American so I asked her for the best Indian restaurant recommendation and she sent me to Dishoom . I ended up going for a late lunch / early dinner , probably around 3 : 30 - 4 : 00pm . That was definitely the perfect timing because as I was leaving the line to get on the list was out the door . I was able to be seated right away . Dishoom is a lot of smaller plates , meant to be shared . I was traveling solo but that wasn ' t going to stop me from trying several items . I started with Lamb Samosas , these had the perfect balance of filling vs . pastry . They were so full of flavor . I dipped them in the trio of sauces they provided as well , so delicious . Next , I had the House Black Daal with garlic naan , and the recommended bowl of greens . The Black Daal is the signature dish , so of course I had to get it . I ' m honestly not even sure what was in it but it was so freaking good . It was packed full of flavor and it paired perfectly with the garlic naan . This was a nice serving portion as well . It filled me up but if shared with someone else I would recommend maybe another dish to share . The greens were also SO full of flavor . I was shocked how good these were . I was very glad the server recommended them . At the end of my meal , I believe the manager came to ask me how everything was . I appreciated him taking the time to come over and check on me . I ordered the Chocolate Pudding and a glass of Chai . The manager gave me the Chai on the house , which was very kind of him . They chocolate pudding was so delicious , I love the hint of chili at the end of each bite . The Chai was by far the best I ' ve ever had . I posted a picture on my facebook and my friend who lives in India said that the Chai was served exactly how it would be served in India , in a glass , not a tea / coffee mug . Overall , I felt like I had a genuine culinary experience . It was the best Indian food I have ever had . If I lived in London this place would take all my money because I would eat here all the time ! ! I highly recommend Dishoom if you ' re in London .\n",

      "Example 0: Dishoom was our first dinner in London ! It was beautiful weather so standing in line for about 40 minutes didn ' t seem like a chore ! They provided us with lemonade in line and then sent us inside to the next part of the line , which was the bar area . Their seating / waiting system was really well thought out and seemed very efficient ! We were seated in under an hour , which was our original quote time . The food was delicious ! We tried a lot of entrees and were absolutely stuffed by the end . We ordered the paneer tikka & vegetable samosas to start , all were delicious . The flavor on the paneer was good ! The chutneys that are served with the breads and starters are amazing ! For dinner we ordered the Lamb Boti Kabab - grilled lamb , which was perfectly cooked and so tasty . The Chicken Tikka flavor was great , the meat is chicken thigh , so be aware if you aren ' t a fan of dark meat ! The Chicken Ruby was also interesting and tasty - a sweet and spicy sauce , it was a unique chicken dish ! We also ordered the Gundpowder Potatoes - SO GOOD , probably my favorite thing we ordered , a variety of spices that really was a perfect combination . A few naan bread as well ! To finish we had the chocolate pudding with chili ice cream . I would say the food is well priced and tasty ! They have a smaller menu , but that allows them to get food out quickly - if you are looking for a lot of the classics you won ' t necessarily find them here . Everyone at the table was impressed with the food . Service at our table is where our review turns a little negative . Service from our specific server was a little lack luster - we had to ask someone else for water that was walking buy with a pitcher . Our server left and went on break during our meal , and so we were left with no one to get our check or clear our table . We waited a significant amount of time and didn ' t spot her , but finally saw her come back in with take away food for her break after 25 minutes . Thankfully we were able to steal a waiter from another area to help us get our check . Overall it was a fun experience - I wish the service at the table would have been as stellar as the service during our wait ! Food was good !\n",

      "Example 0: My family was visiting London for our first time ( from California ) , and one of the most important & most anticipated parts of the itinerary was dinner at Dishoom . The food was incredible ; the manager actually recommended we ordered the cheese naan to pair with a chicken curry , and it unanimously was everybody ' s favorite dish . The house IPA paired well with it as well ! Of course , we ordered chai at the end of dinner and it was absolutely perfect . The service was unforgettable and made the whole dining experience so special for my entire family . One of the managers ended up giving us an impromptu tour of the place , and we talked to him for a while about the way the art in the restaurant represents certain parts of Indian history / decolonization , and how that related back to our personal history ! I ' ll definitely have to come back here every chance I get , and if I could teleport every single person I meet who knows how to appreciate Indian food here , I would . Also , be sure to make a reservation to save some time !\n",

      "Example 0: Several friends and I were out late at night in London when they suggested indian food and being in london where indian food is supposed to be the best , of course I was down . Stupid me tho thought this was going to be a quick and dirty meal or a buffet style like they have in the states but boy was I wrong . . . and gladly so ! We didn ' t end up having it that night since I soon realized how popular of a place Dishoom is but upon entering and smelling the wonderful aromas of food I decided that we absolutely HAD to come back to try this place before we left for home ! We were able to get a quick seat coming to this location for lunch around 11 and we ordered basically everything that was popular on the menu and that our waiter suggested ! We got the chicken ruby , pau bhaji ( 10 / 10 ) would recommend , garlic naan , house black daal , and lamb shanks ( not a lamb fan usually , but would also def recommend . the pomegranate seeds are a unique touch ) . for the three of us , we honestly planned to order so much more food since it is served tapas style but our waiter warned us ( so sorry I forgot his name but he was wonderful ! ) that it would be a lot and he was definitely right , we were SO full ! The decor of this place was adorable and everything is so nicely presented . it ' s also priced really well for the food you get ! I will DEFINITELY be back on my next trip across the pond , I already miss it SO much just typing this ! !\n",

      "Example 0: varunmurali . com / blog / dis … Irani cafes have this inexplicable homely feeling about them . I absolutely love going to Kyaani with my brother back in Bombay . At Kyaani you have to get the buttery bun maska , spicy and juicy chicken farcha with the delicious gravy poured all over it , and of course the timeless salli boti . I ' ve actually never been to an Irani cafe outside of Bombay even within India . So when I head about Dishoom a couple weeks ago I was stoked ! So many people recommended it to me so there was little chance I would skip visiting this homage to Bombay ' s Irani cafes . I really wanted to love Dishoom , but unfortunately I felt a little let down . Though the menu was stacked with favorites of Indian cuisine , I saw few traditional Parsi dishes on it . They did have bun maska ( though not for lunch ) and keema pav and a few other classics . DishesThe keema pav was pretty delicious . Spicy and authentic . Complemented the hot buttered pav really well . I would have been content to stop right there given how filling and value for money that single dish was . My friend who I was eating with vouched for the okra fries . He was not wrong . They were super tangy and chatpata . Fried well and not oily at all . My friend ordered the pav bhaji . Not a fan . The bhaji was waaaaay too smooth . I strongly believe you should be able to actually tell what you ' re eating in a pav bhaji . You need different textures to come through . The bhaji also tasted almost too creamy . It felt more like a paneer makhani sauce than bhaji .   The chicken biryani was the biggest let down . Mild , bland , uninspired . The chicken was tender I ' ll give it that . Not much else going on with the dish . It was just mushy and the rice was over cooked . You can ' t keep me away from black dal . The menu featured it as one of their best items so we ordered it . Good , not great . Could definitely use a bit more flavor but the expected creaminess was there for sure . Oh and the rose lassis were pretty great ! Would I come back ? I think I would maybe once a month or so , but I would definitely stick to the smaller dishes and appetizers . Unless someone else at the table orders a main course that tastes good that is ! I think the small plates are super value for money . They get you pretty full and taste great . Definitely worth checking out !\n"

Now orginally my wife and i were going to head to DUM biryani house but saw the greaaat reviews and number of reviews for DISHOOM . So i ll go thru pros and consPROS - ambience is amazing . The lighting the old indians photos were superb touchThe cocktails honestly were the best part of the entire experience . I had an excellent manhattan and my wife a colada . So no issues there . Service was great . All employees were friendly . To the food . Best dish we had was the chicken tikka off the grill . Tender and flavorful and with the chutney selection you could make as spicey or mild as neededMattar paneer was good with excellent flavors and one of there signature dishes the black dhal was on point i must say . Cons - spicy lamb chops , first werent spicy and second they were overcooked . Cmon man there should be some red . We also got the signature prawn moilee in a yellow curry and it was just OK man . I mean the shrimp was a bit over cooked . I wouldnt even say they were prawns . It wasnt bland but i did have high expectations . My wife ordered some coleslaw and felt the yogurt in their mightve been old . To summarize id say its a good place overall but if your expecting curries like some tikka masala vindaloo or saag . . yea not here . I mean im torn , i think people will enjoy the overall experience in general but really if youve been to other indian restuarants around the world this isnt even top 5 food wise . Go enjoy and have drinks and other small plates and judge for urself\n"

Small plates : We had the okra fries , lamb samosas , and keema pau - all SO amazing . The keema pau is Iranian and was soooo delicious - the lamb is flavorful and a little oily , which makes it go perfectly with the homemade bun that goes with it ( which is toasted to perfection ! ) . Mains : between the two days we tried the chicken ruby ( twice ! ! ) which is basically their version of butter chicken . It is honestly the best butter chicken I ' ve ever had . We also had the chicken berry biryani which was delicious - the berries gave it a nice and different flavor . We also had the house black daal which was delicious , and I ' m a huge daal lover . My bf also had the dishoom chicken tikka roll was very tasty also . And of course we had garlic naan with it all ! Drinks : my bf tried the dishoom pale ale and thought it was really good ! I also had the bollybellini which was very tasty , but definitely a sweet cocktail . I also had the baileys chai which was so delicious , perfect amounts of both and an amazing cream on top . Dessert : we had the dishoom chocolate pudding - so good ! ! It ' s more of a molten chocolate flourless cake , less like a traditional American pudding . It comes with a spicy chili ice cream which is so unique . Overall very delicious\n",

      "Example 0: I have to say - - I didn ' t think the 45 - minute wait on a Monday night would be worth it , but happily , I was wrong . The service once you get inside Dishoom is top - notch and the Indian food is above average ( had the black daal , the Chicken Ruby , the Roomali Roti and a cheese naan ) , but I ' m not sure it was necessarily the greatest Indian I ' ve ever had . . . maybe , in part , because I ' ve been to India twice and loved the food on those trips . But then ? I had the lamb samosas for dessert . Sweet Jesus , these were amazing . The samosas canopy shells were fantastic , the minced lamb inside was tasty , and the three spices left on my table were all excellent . If I could make reservations here and know my seating time , I would have eaten here a couple more times to try other items on the menu .

      "Example 0: Had a fantastic experience at Dishoom Covent Garden . We were a family of 10 and were seated right on time at a booth that just about fit all of us . The set menu for 10 had a lot of variety and our server went above and beyond to accommodate us , particularly since we had a specific food allergy that we hadn ' t noted beforehand , but somewhat surprisingly ended up being a staple ingredient in many dishes . Our server , Thomas , went back to the kitchen to get a full breakdown of what did and did not have that ingredient on the entire menu and the restaurant was willing to swap some of the small plates for us based on this assessment . Thomas also came back to explain which of the set menu dishes would be free of the allergen . We really appreciate his efforts and positive attitude . All of the food was delicious and portioned nicely . The appetizers on the set menu were a little spicy for my table but the entrees had a lot fewer spicy dishes . My personal favourite is the chicken tikka masala ! Our table also really enjoyed the jackfruit biryani . The rice pudding for dessert was also really good . Definitely make a reservation ! Set menu for tables of 10 or over .\n",
