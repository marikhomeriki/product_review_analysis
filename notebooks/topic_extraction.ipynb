I was not really hungry but I was craving a little something sweet so I asked him to get me a McFlurry and to call me and tell me what kind they have. He calls and they have Oreo, M&M, and Butterfinger. YUM! I want Butterfinger I exclaimed! He hangs up and calls back about a minute later to break the news to me that they are out of Butterfinger. That would've been useful info to have when he first asked! So I ended up with Oreo. He comes back and I take a bite of my McFlurry. For those who may not know a McFlurry is soft serve icecream mixed with whatever topping you get. How do you possibly mess that up? Messing up a McFlurry is equal to the stupidity of burning cornflakes! There is no excuse. I took one bite and threw it away. The icecream was warm and the oreo chucks were stale. NASTY!

       "  \"Today was the breaking point. Long ago, McDonald's revolutionized the restaurant industry with fast food dining, a paragon of what was possible when human ingenuity applied itself to streamline processes and deliver maximum production and food for people in the least amount of time. These days, efficiency no longer matters and has been replaced with indifference, complacency, and a lack of disregard to customer priorities. On most mornings, I will stop into McDonald's to grab a yogurt parfait for $1.12 as my morning breakfast. I did it because it was a healthy breakfast, tasted good, and was amazingly cheap. Before today, one of the top ten things I associate with McDonald's is efficiency, and today I can throw that word out the window because McDonald's no longer merits it.Today I left my house early for the express purpose of ordering more food for breakfast because I didn't have dinner and I was short on sleep and needed a giant coffee to go with some food to keep me sane for a long day at work. I arrived at 8:44am and I know this because Foursquare told me so when I checked in! Something was amiss and there was a large crowd of people and lines that were simply not moving.Great, these things sometimes happen, which was why I was glad that I left my house early so that if I actually did have to wait in line it wouldn't matter and I'd still be able to get what I wanted when I wanted it. The minutes started flying by and the line still wasn't moving! What happened to that proud tradition of corporate efficiency to deliver the customer what they wanted when they wanted with the highest degree of professionalism and courtesy? Well you can all forget about it because it's clear that no one in this McDonald's during the morning shift gives one iota of care for anyone waiting in line.I got to be the third person in line when two customers started to argue with the cashier that they wanted cream on the side of their coffee and not mixed in. The clerk wouldn't make a new coffee for the customers and the customers weren't having any of it. Watching these people argue with the clerk got my blood boiling because I was trying to get an order in and get to work on time! Î¾Because of the inability of the clerk to placate these customers I ended up stuck in line waiting, waiting, and waiting in what seemed to be forever!Having arrived at 8:44am, it was now 8:54am and I hadn't made an order! I yelled in frustration about the utter lack of disregard the staff had much to the amusement of the other patrons who were all either waiting for their order or waiting to order who all were in the same boat. I slammed the door on leaving and walked a block over to Starbucks. At Starbucks I spent $5 for a giant cup of coffee and no food - $5 I could have easily spent at McDonald's in order to get what I wanted, but apparently McDonald's no longer cares about earning my money since they are too busy arguing with other customers and making everyone wait to order and wait for their food. Long gone are the good old days of the quick food restaurant, this McDonald's no longer adheres to any sense of time or service and has degenerated into the ultimate display of incompetency. There are not enough words in all of the languages I speak to describe the disgust that I experienced today at this McDonald's. It was disgraceful and a thorough exercise in human futility and it was ten minutes of my life that I will never gain back.\",\n",

Only halfway through our meal did my mom notice her drink tasted funny... She looked at her receipt and saw the cashier made one drink a Coke Zero. I went to the counter for her and told Samantha, the manager, that the drink was wrong and I\\'d like a Diet Coke. She said the drink was half empty and I\\'d have to buy a new one. The shock on my face washed over her like she was a piece of smooth sea glass. My mom also tried to reason with her - \"Shouldn\\'t the customer get what they actually ordered?!\" No. No you can not. Samantha then took my mom\\'s receipt and threw it away. My mom asked for it back so she can officially complain. I give them credit for following up, but they\\'re a lost cause.

A gentleman in the parking lot was kind enough to offer me the address and phone number of the towing facility, for whom he worked... I DO NOT hold the towing company responsible for doing what they believe is their job. I do, however, hold this business responsible for hiring people without a sense of observation, intelligence, common sense, humility, and accountability. Don\\'t waste your property, cash, time, nor curiosity to even look at this place, because it\\'s filthy on the inside: the floors of overlooked dirt and grime, door handles with more grease than gears in a sewing machine, the food always arrives after your next birthday (it seems) to get when \"prepared,\" and I don\\'t think anyone has looked up at me once to offer me a sense of being heard and understood. When the staff rings up your receipt, they do nothing but look on in fatigue at their own reflections, and observe a strange sense of love, from cold comforts in the scratched up, \"stained-less\" steel counter tops.To the CDC: save a life, and look twice--the dirt and trained monkeys might have escaped from the same lab and work somewhere inside. The only thing fresh in this place is what will be on the toilette paper the next day as a result of the oil that, I imagine, was obtained from an underworld market exchange fashioned by cheap costs and the flesh of missing persons.

The order was messed up as soon as the person taking the order realized she couldn't get me my milkshakes, which meant she had over charged our credit card. She had no idea what to do about that and had to get the manager who then acted like it was my fault and refunded the cash for one milkshake. However, there were two ordered and two charged so she had to then refund more cash - these milkshakes costs over three additional bucks over the normal price of the meal we ordered that included drinks - I know confusing. So after refunding the cash - I asked what I could get to drink and she said that would cost more - there was no drinks that would come with my meal???? So I just got a freaking glass of ice water!The place was not clean - the service was P@## Poor and I would NEVER return to this location.

Î¾The cashier was the only one on duty (at 7:30pm on a weeknight) and as he tried to do his job, his manager spent the entire time I was there (about twenty minutes) berating him for not doing his job correctly.When I got my cup of tea, I took it to my table, looked inside and saw...no teabag. Î¾I went back to get the teabag and then sat back down at a gross table that had soda spilled on it. Î¾Thing is, the soda had *dried* and made the table top quite sticky. Î¾As I waited for my tea to cool, a guy decided to throw himself into his seat, rocking the table and sending half the tea into my lap. Î¾Oh joy.Now I know McD's isn't responsible for this guy being an idiot, but the table was pretty big and for it to be that unstable that a guy jumping into a booth would rock it so badly is just sad.I left utterly disgusted with this place. Î¾It's a shame because the interior was decorated very nicely, including a nice wood frame that resembles a house inside, but now has scratches all over it (most looking like deliberate graffiti). Î¾Between that and the condition the table I sat at was in, I hope to never return to this place.\",\n",

It has a bathroom you can use, is kind of nice inside (for a McDonald's) and you can use a credit card, in case you're out of dead presidents.I had breakfast here once with a staffer. During our conversation, I was told that this McDonald's used to be a crematorium and was HAUNTED. Of all the damnedest things that I could hear, I was not expecting that. It was also mentioned that the staff doesn't go into the basement (?) storage area, or if they do, they go in pairs.Haunted or not, I still come here for my late night McGriddle fix. Where else can you get sinfully unhealthy food for bargain prices?

About 2 minutes later I begin hearing a ton of static and then this bizarre sounding guy starts talking in this strange tone. He sounded like a drunk Orson Wells. When I pulled up to the first window to pay, the window slowly slid open to reveal the face of a morbid looking kid with gigantic dilated eyes and one of those horror movie smiles. Immediately he lets out this high pitched: \"reeehhhhhhhhhhhhhh!!!\" noise at me. At that particular moment, due to the fear of man-rape, I thought about driving over the planters and escaping. But, he looked so weird that I came to the conclusion that he might have some kind of paranormal super powers and would catch me no matter how fast I drove, so I just sat there and awaited my fate. After about 2-3 seconds he told me how much my coffee cost in a disturbingly soft tone voice, and thankfully he didn\\'t serve me McRape. Î¾When I drove up to the pick-up window, I was greeted by an anorexic looking latino kid who didn\\'t even give me eye contact, and while holding the coffee he sticks his arm out the window and just drops it before I even have the chance to reach out to grab it.

All things being fair, the culinary experience was doomed for failure given certain personal and tragic circumstances I won\\'t get into here.Upon stepping to the counter, I gave pause to the abbreviated menu not worthy of a McDonald\\'s Express, which is a new concept to me all-together. I decided to play it safe with the classic cheeseburger meal with an intimidating amount of fries and drink aka \"The Value Meal\". My meal was served up a little too quickly with all due credit to the server. The food seemed to appear from nowhere - gremlins cooking the food? I could see the grease seeping through one of the burger wrappers. At this point I made a snap substitution request, no coke, coffee instead - a hot beverage will make the grease go down smoother. My server obligated me in silence and I acknowledged her generosity. I took my tray and chose a seat by the front windows where parked cars would treat the diner with blinding light from their headlights, but at least it was somewhat devoid of the cold glowing light emitting from the overhead florescent located in the rear of the restaurant.I sat down and emptied the contents of the bag, fries and napkins, no ketchup. I tasted one of the fries to determine if they were worthy of ketchup-free consumption, but alas no, they were slightly cold with a texture that left an unpleasant lump in your throat. I fetched several ketchup packets from the server, kept under tight security behind the counter and returned to my table.Spilling out the ketchup packets on the table, I noticed dried droplets of ketchup on the plastic packets. No turning back now, I dug into my dinner with a overwhelming sadness for humanity and myself. So, to sum up:Fries. They left an odd taste of seafood or fish to my palette. Perhaps they co-mingled food in the fryer. The luke-warm temparture made it a bit difficult to choke them down. Maybe some beer would have helped the process.Cheeseburgers. Lifting the top bun of any burger, you can tell right away if there was any love in the preparation. Though consumable, the burgers were not satisfying and tasted as if they sat under a heat lamp for too long, also lukewarm.Coffee. I have tasted better coffee from a mechanical contraption in a corporate lunch room. It was watery, lukewarm and slightly sweet in a way that amplified everything that went wrong with the coffee.Ketchup Packets. Looks like they were dropped on the floor at some point or recycled from a previous diner that did not use up all their ketchup.Customer Service.

I dont understand how hard it is to slap a piece of fake meat onto a bun and throw the correct condiments on...unless you cant read the ticket, which honestly wouldnt be surprising. There is one employee who EVERY time we go just happens to take a break, sit in a chair near to us and scream, yell, bitch and cuss to her hearts content on her cell phone. I dont care if your on a break, you still represent your workplace because you are still wearing the uniform and sitting in the lobby.

However, last night, for the first time I ordered food (grilled chicken salad) I returned it ~ the meat smelled BADLY. This did not surprise me and only enforced my resolve to avoid chain food restaurants.What did surprise me and absolutely SHOCKED me was the customer service offered by employees ~ HOW in the world can you BE an employee here and NOT for ONE MINUTE or even a second acknowledge the obvious FACT that you work inside a HOSPITAL; then consider what that means for each and every person that approaches your counter to order. HOW you do not SEE them, in FACT that you easily DISMISS them, is beyond my comprehension to understand! HOW you lost your sense of humanity, in all honestly should cause you to pause and contemplate this ~ Are you not aware that you are reflecting how YOU measure within YOU your own sense of dignity?Within my and family/friends of patient at Northside Hospital for the past 11 weeks: each and every time I/they had to place an order I /they was/were subjected to McDonalds toxic business model (in food) which now has transferred (we learned) into their employees. NOT once was I thanked for giving my order; NOT ONCE was I thanked when delivered my order. Yet, at EVERY visit I WAITED and witnessed employee behaviors that were readily displayed and relayed in body language, effort toward actual work, and obvious attitude not only toward me, but guests in front of me. God forbid I happened to have question in reference to the menu (employee response: blank stare, shrug, looking behind them at menu only to turn back around with a blank stare and/or shrug again).

       "  \"Years of pathetic service, disgusting food, and dangerous mistakes. Why do I keep going back?Having nothing to do with Mcdonalds food in general and more to do with the ability of this specific location to produce it with out killing anybody. I have been going to this particular store for years. It is right around the corner from where I used to live, and is on the way from where I live to pretty much everything I use (gas station, costco, movie theater, market, etc). It is the only convenient location, and for a while Mcdonalds was the only place that had $1 drinks. So those are my lame excuses for repeatedly torturing myself with this horrible place! Service: I used to be a manager with another fast food chain. I know what service SHOULD be. I also know what it usually is. It doesn't have to be 5 star. But the rude attitudes, ridiculously slow service, and inability to get a single order right is really a bit too much. When I say slow service, I am talking 15 minutes is average drive thru time for a dollar menu burger and a soda. Correct orders: Yes, my order can occasionally be complicated (no castup, add big mac sauce)... but when I thought they could do no worse... they messed up an order for 4 large drinks. 2 diet cokes, a lemonade, and an unsweet iced tea (all with extra ice). We received a regular coke, a lemonade, a Dr. Pepper, and a sweet iced tea. 2 drinks had no ice at all. and the other 2 had a few pieces floating around. We have never received a correct order from this store. EVER. I could go on and on about it, but I will stick with this sad example and move on.Dangerous/disgusting/incorrectly made: Something a little different then an order where they put the wrong thing in the bag or mess up a custom, is when they just make it incorrectly or dangerously. Some of the examples of this include pies that expired an hour before I received them, an egg that was completely raw in the middle, and tonights lovely mess up. Tonight I ordered the Angus Mushroom and Swiss. According to the website this should include 2 full slices of swiss cheese and a decent amount of mushrooms. I had about a teaspoon of mushrooms, no sauce, and 1/2 a slice of cheese. That is right, they left off a slice and a half of cheese! In addition, it was a regular (and relatively old) quarter pound patty, not the big ole angus patty they should have used. I have called the number on the receipt multiple times that takes me to the district office. They consistently send out a free sandwich or drink coupon to apologize. They tell me how sorry they are and suggest I try one of their other locations, as this is the only one they receive complaints from. From what I was told they are revamping this store, but I have been told that for well over a year, and it seems to have been unvamped and going down hill, which I didn't think was even possible! I keep vowing this will be my last visit, but then find myself sitting in the drive thru line yet again wondering if I will ever receive my food. I highly do not recommend this location.

I've had this happen a million times in the morning when I'm in a hurry to get to work. When this location first opened they would ask if you wanted cream/sugar in your coffee, several times I asked for cream and Splenda and got sugar instead. I've noticed lately, that they don't even ask anymore, in fact I have to ask when I get to the window, and they don't seem sad at all that I have to pull over and fix my own coffee.

I called and the manager was super nice apologized and offered me two meals at no cost and never mentioned I needed a receipt because I had already told her I threw it away. She said she would just write down my name and put it in the books. I take up the offer on a different day and they don't know what I'm talking about, I pay but get home and the buns are burnt and the order was wrong again. I asked for no meat on the mcmuffin for my daughter and what do they add on, meat. Yeah I can take it off myself but the point is is obviously they do not listen to there customers or just don't pay attention, I mean every encounter there they always forget, or simply make a mistake. Either way I'm taking my business else where. Management is not organized and you can't trust their words! The crew is super nice though!

I haven't tried the fries yet! Anyway, the fries were either over cooked,( I don't think so), or cooked twice. The amount of salt was unreal and the fries were cooked beyond crispy.Second trip, the fries looked like McDonalds fries just not very warm, and yes he drove off before I tried one. We get back to the R.V. resort we're staying at and I try my Big Mac, almost no sauce and very bland.

So you can imagine my disappointment with their terrible service and bad quality food making!! Worst. Worst. Worst. I get they are new. I do, so the first few times I went, I kept my cool, didn't complain, smiled, etc. I like to go mid-morning on my way to work for either just coffee and a Sausage McMuffin with no egg... How complicated of an order can it be??!! Sometimes I will mix it up and get a combo meal, this is usually where they royally screw it up. I'm irritated just thinking about the visits Ive had and how 4 out of 5 visits they screwed something up. To make this brief, here are my major issues. I order Splenda to be added to my drink. I'm in my work clothes, and I don't want to pull over and carefully add it myself and spill on my clothes since they A) they always fill it too high, and B) I don't want to make any more stops! Cheese: hardly ever melted on the Quarter Pounder, or Big Mac and I've tried about 3 or 4 times. Cheese not melted, or the tiniest blob of sauce! I wanted the new habanero ranch, couldn't even taste the sauce except for one bite! Plus it was luke-warm at least twice! The hot & spicy with a tiny splash of mayo? I mean, really! I ordered an iced Caramel Mocha, get to the window, she hands me the latte, it had no caramel on the whip, so I ask, is this the Caramel Mocha? She stares at me blankly and says yes, I say, I'm used to it having caramel on top, she says its a caramel mocha, so off to work I go, I'm already late because they are super SLOW, and sure enough take a sip after I'm gone and it's a regular mocha. Pathetic service!I did write in to corporate after my 8th or 10th attempt to do business there.. And the manager called me and apologized. Told me to come in and get a free combo on him. So not happening. Go in so they can remember me as the Girl who called them out for their shit slow service, always messing up my orders, Î¾and crap food making? No thanks. I would have rather had some coups sent so I could remain anonymous. Oh well. I just drive a few more blocks down to Rainbow and Blue Diamond location if i have the extra time, they are great! As for this place? Shame on you for STILL not being able to get your shit together! One positive note I will say is there are two very friendly employees there. They work the drive thru taking orders/$$ I wish I had their names! Will I be back? Sadly probably yes, it's very convenient for me on my way to work when I don't have time to go to rainbow location.. But I limit what I get, try to keep it simple and always hope for the best...

I have a rule for myself. I never fight with people that make my food behind closed doors. Yea, maybe paranoid but sadly its a reality. So I was completely polite about canceling my order. I do believe they did the right thing by offering me these breakfast items. Where i find the problem is the simple lack of customer service.

The Blue Diamond Road landscape seems to change every week. New to the landscape is the old familiar Golden Arches sign. After hiking for six hours I was exhausted and needed a snack.

To temporarily hold over my appetite and enjoy a beverage besides water that I had been drinking all the day on the hike, I ordered the $1 large Coke and $1 hot & spicy. Î¾Being a new McDonalds this location is modern and for now immacuately clean. First off it is a nice first impression when a McDonald's is not part of a gas station, like the one down the road at Blue Diamond and Rainbow. I entered through modern electric sliding doors. There were two managers, and I got a nice greeting. The workers were on top of their game. There were plenty of booths to choose from. The interior is more contemporary than McDonald Land. The McDonald Playland is nonexistent. What does exist is a chandelier and a more elegant lobby. They did not go modern to the point of some restaurants that feature the super Coke machines with a 100 plus flavors. The typical Coke flavors they had were not flat. McDonald's may not be 4 star dining. However, when I just want a snack to fill me up or a Frape Caramel; McDonald's gets the job done. The Daniel. S Yelp 100 Challenge. Review 88.\",\n",

Î¾When I write a review I try to look at a unique aspect of the business. When it comes to fast food restaurants, it takes some thinking. What makes this McDonald\\'s unique is that it features the exact Western motif displayed throughout Sam\\'s Town. It is incorporated in a food court in back of the mountain where the robotic Mystic Falls robotic animals perform. I don\\'t know of any McDonald\\'s where I could grab a Big Mac and fries and watch a robotic cast of animals performing in a laser show, What also makes this McDonald;s unique for a location off the Strip is that they do not honor the $1 Any Size Beverage promotion. Î¾The Sam\\'s Town McDonald\\'s is one of a few food choices in Sam\\'s Town. In my opinion I pass over their coffee and dessert for Dunkin Donuts. I pass over their lunch and dinner menu for the Firelight Buffet, Panda Express, and Subway. For my tastes, this McDonald\\'s is advantageous for a light snack or a Large Coke for the drive home. The time I spend on the line justifies a check-in. It is the McDonald\\'s of Sam\\'s Town, and it gets busy. In comparison to a similar McDonald\\'s in the D casino, the employees are friendly.

I open up the box and there lies this lettucey thing with some kind of salad dressing on it. It is cold and damp. This must be an artistic statement of some kind. Possibly a commentary on the ill treatment of the Intuit natives at the turn of the last century. I am impressed by the chefs social concerns but I had wished that the food was hot. I took a bite . I am glad that I sat close to the toilet as I made a run for it. They must have been upset that I ordered the foie gras originally. They are making me pay for it. I know when I have been defeated. My pomme frites were hot but lacking any French accoutrements. This must be French cooking under the Vichy government when the Germans took away their cream and tried to make them eat sausages.

Now for the bad news: Î¾high volume McDonalds have been trying different line workflows for the last six months, at least at this location and the one in Union Station, and with the recent automation implemented you can expect to wait 10 minutes for a cup of coffee. Î¾As another review said, it's probably because it does seem like chaos to stand in a line 2-3 deep, place your order, and then step aside in front of the people who ordered before you, so the person fulfilling the order can shuttle to the counter & back delivering your bag of food. Î¾This actually got you your food pretty quickly, even in peak times.So now the newest system is a single register to take orders, and an electronic system that shows order numbers that are ready on a TV screen. Î¾Sounds great, right? Î¾Not at this location. Î¾For some reason their fulfillment process is very very slow. Î¾It took 10 minutes the other day for my order to come up, and with the old system, it would be 2-3 minutes consistently, I think it was faster because there were four individual teams working on fulfilling orders, not a centralized mainly single-threaded process with the new system.This morning I walked in, saw the line in front of the register was 2 deep, and 20 people were waiting for their orders (20!). Î¾This isn't DeKalb where a busload of people just walked in. Î¾It's McDonalds, and they clearly need to to fix something with this store / their new process, or just change back to the old chaotic system that got you your food in 2-3 minutes consistently.\",\n",

Î¾I understand the people working the counter are getting minimum wage or slightly higher and are not super excited about their jobs or innovating the industry.But seriously, will someone take my damn order already!??I can't count the number of times I have been here where I stand in line at a register and when I finally get to the front the person is running around without any clear direction running food to other registers for the people who arrived after me but were lucky enough to win the register lottery. Î¾Multiple times I have had to get someone's attention and remind them that I am still waiting to place my order.It's not rocket science. Î¾Heck, it's not even science. Î¾It's service. Î¾Plain and simple. Î¾Divide and conquer: one group of people take orders and another group of people run the food while yet another makes it in the back. Î¾Sounds simple, right? Î¾Well it doesn't appear so simple when you walk into this McDonald's.I have worked in the food service industry as a waiter and I understand that people have different ideas on what is good service but one thing is always constant: greet your customer and communicate with them. Î¾Let them know if you'll be a minute; inform them if there's a wait. Î¾Whatever the issue just let them know; they'll appreciate you more for it and be more willing and patient to wait.Other than the service this is, well, McDonald's. Î¾Doesn't matter which one you go to you get pretty much the same thing. Î¾That's the hallmark of their business. Î¾The only difference is service.So, pay attention franchisees: McDonald's may continue to get my money but you independent franchise owners may soon lose valuable customers with poor service.Afterall, there's a McDonald's within a couple miles just about anywhere in developed countries.\",\n",

       "  \"I've been living in this neighborhood since I was 4. Back in the day, the cheapest place to get a burger and fries was Maxwell's on 31st. In my family during that time, eating at Mcdonalds was luxury item. Why was it a luxury? Because my parents highly frowned upon processed and can foods. As a rebellious child growing up, eat at a Mcdonald's was luxury. The closest place without a car had to be in McKinley Park. Fast forward a few years and the McDonald's express opened. Despite it being fastfood, it poses as a treat to all the locals in the neighborhood; after playing sports at Mcguane or just grabbing a quick bite. This Mcdonald's is very small compared to other Mcdonalds, but they do serve most items. Since they marketed their $1 menu couple of years ago, the dollar menu has never changed. McChickens and Mcdoubles were always a $1. Now with the advertised $1 breakfast menus and any size drink, there are a lot of cheap options. My only grievance is that they don't have sweet tea and salads, but unsweetened tea is available. It doesn't feel right to goto any McDonalds for a salad... it just doesn't make sense to me.I come here a couple times a month for ice coffee, hot coffee and a sandwich or two. The location is convenient to grab a quick bite, pick up my dry cleaning, or pick up a few small items from Walgreens. The occurrence of pan-handlers has increased since Pacific Garden Missions moved to Canal St and it has also died down since the new police station has been placed on 31st and Halsted.

Î¾That\\'s Express, people!The only thing that drags this place down is the atmosphere.

This McDonald\\'s is directly across the street from my apartment.So, after witnessing a guy smash his van (we later were told by the po-po that it was stolen) into the light pole right at the corner, then watching him exit the vehicle and run maniacly down North Ave., away from the scene, we decided we were hungry. We thought \"why not go to McD\\'s\". Seems logical. I mean, McD\\'s is always the same no matter where you go, right? And it was certainly conveniently located. At least it appears conveniently located. Oh, its not. Attempting to cross North Ave. at my intersection is really a situation where you are taking your life into your hands.

Yet, there are never more than 2 registers open at once. And the only people working those registers are either a. ancient, non-english speaking women b. mentally handicapped.

Couple that with the fact that its the only McDonald\\'s I have ever seen that has Jalepeno\\'s as a condiment and the fact that they look at me as if I am lost every time I walk in there, I think its safe to say the clientele here is pretty set.Overall, the location, service and neighborhood sucks.

       "  \"Never thought I'd write a review about a McDonald's, but I feel compelled. Î¾This one was just re-built, replacing a perfectly servicable old one. Î¾Whatever, it's their money.My problem with the new one is that its parking lot configuration and ease of ingress/egress is even more stupid than the old one, if that's possible. Î¾You see, if you're coming from the east, entrance into the lot, either via entrances on North Avenue or Lowell (one way north), is no problem. Î¾If you're coming from the west on North Avenue (or from the south on Kostner), you literally cannot enter the parking lot. Î¾At all. I thought by turning left onto Kostner (a fairly main-drag kind of street), I could enter (as you could with the old one). Î¾Nope. Î¾No entrance any more on Kostner. Î¾And you cannot turn left from North Avenue to Lowell because there's a median (I think: either way, you're risking an accident or a ticket). Î¾There's an alley directly behind the lot, which is not only fenced off from Mickey D's, but 'one way' going out. Î¾So I drive AROUND THE BLOCK, past Lowell (the one-way street next to McDonald's), to Kildare, back to North Avenue, then enter. Î¾Jesus. Î¾The entrance has one of those divided-curb thingys, which was barely wide enough for my compact car. Î¾There are TWO drive-thru lanes from which to order food, but then they merge into one waiting line, so you can end up in this single line ahead of someone who's been waiting longer, or vice-versa, so why bother? Î¾The rest was standard McDonald's (WHY can't you at least offer me salsa for my breakfast burrito?)....I got no sauce, no ketchup, no napkins, nuthin'.OK, then to get out and go back east on North Avenue, you must basically repeat the maze-bullshit from above, only in the reverse. Î¾You used to be able to exit onto Kostner, then turn left on North Avenue. Î¾Now you are forced to either go west on Grand or North Avenue or go to Lowell, north Î¾to Wabansia (past a high school) to Kildare to North Avenue. Î¾Got all that? Î¾Apparently the city thinks it's more desirable for us to drive around an entire neighborhood than to use the only (inexplicably) one-way alley in the entire neighborhood to get home from fucking McDonald's.

Usually going through drive-thru, they never charge extra for a McDouble w/o the ketchup, w/ big mac sauce and shredded lettuce (a.k.a a Big Mac, but cheaper!). My boyfriend and I were pretty shocked when she told us we had to pay extra for the sauce and she claimed that they always do this which they really NEVER DO!!Then, this same lady proceeded to close the cash register before giving me my change! She told me to wait on the side so she can give it to me after she opens it for the next customer. So I patiently waited... and then she closed the cash register AGAIN after the next customer and totally forgot to give me my change!!!! So I had to remind her again to which she just laughed and semi-apologized and then finally gave me my change after like a decade of waiting! ARGH! Worst McDonalds worker ever!! Completely rude and horrible customer service skills! I totally agree with my boyfriend who said this McDonalds is very poorly managed. He even wrote a complaint to them a while back but they never responded. \"We love to see you smile?\" I beg to differ.',\n",

It\\'s a chain with no \"indie cred\", but it\\'s hard to deny that a sausage, egg and cheese biscuit is delicious even if it\\'s not served by a cool guy with a handlebar mustache.So I rolled up to the San Fernando location, just blocks away from the infamous Drew Street and former Avenues Gang stronghold. The drive through line was looooong and I thought, \"I\\'ll just go in!\" That\\'ll be quick, right?The interior was that edge-of-anarchy you only get on a Saturday in a sketchy corner of a big city. Kids, post-soccer games all jacked up on Cokes and orange slices, a dense crowd that stands a liiiiitle to close, a few vagrants and an overwhelmed staff that handles it fairly well.I finally left about 15 minutes later (yes, really), after several false alarms of \"Oh! I think that\\'s mine.\" Î¾Ironically, my ORANGE JUICE is what held up the order while I watched the biscuit, McMuffin and hashy-b\\'s get cold. Î¾I walked out politely but my head was spinning with entitled yuppie frustration and thoughts of \"Well, I\\'m never going in there again.\" One time, no joke, I got a cheeseburger with no burger! Kinda hilarious actually, and the manager came through for me with a TWO free cheeseburgers as an apology. Despite all that, YOU KNOW I\\'LL STILL BE BACK. Î¾Maybe not IN the location, but in the drive through for sure. Î¾Don\\'t get me started on the 2-lane merging drive through.

Not a problem, since I would never sit down and eat here anyway. However, the customer service is pretty darn poor, and my 1 star is based solely on that (I have no expectations for McDonald's foods).They do not have enough staff. There was exactly one person working in the 'kitchen' (making burgers), one person working soda/fries/ice creams (who I assumed to be the manager) and one person working the cashier. Now I understand that they're working minimum wage, but that does not excuse them to work so poorly. I had to repeat my order four times, and it took 30 minutes to be completed. Why? Because the cashier was VERY distracted from conversing with friends and coworkers. I would give zero stars, but 1 star is for the manager, who seemed to be the only one who was trying to fulfill the customers orders.I haven't been to a McDonalds in years, and this experience will serve as a reminder to me of why I should continue not to do so.\",\n",

People were pulling up behind me and I was losing my patience. Finally some lady came on the intercom and said \"What can I get you?\" As if they were the ones waiting on me to decide. I could hear a lot of noise in the background (sounded chaotic). I asked for a grilled chicken wrap. She responded with \"We don\\'t have grilled meat, wait yeah ok grilled what else?\" Then I asked for Sprite. \"We\\'re out of Sprite.\" Ok please give me unsweet ice tea. \"OK Sweet tea.\" At that point, my headache was so bad I didn\\'t even try to ask for the frickin unsweet tea.

As I\\'m waiting to pay and get my food, I see at least two cars leave the drive thru line because they\\'re fed up with the poor service.

The burger was your typical McD's burger, nothing special, tastes like a very cheap, almost beef patty. The fries however, looked and tasted like they had been dropped into the fryer a couple times. Finally, the soda... there was a slightly off taste to it, could be the mix, or the syrup was on its way out, either way, it wasn't the greatest tasting soda I have had.After eating, I went to get my drink refilled, as they normally give one refill per cup at this location. Not this time. Now, if you would like a refill, it is $0.54. I was really tempted to break out the credit card to pay for a refill, just out of spite. Laziness prevailed and I walked away. I can understand not having unlimited refills at a mall, where mallrats could abuse the refill policy. That is why it was perfectly understandable to have only one refill per cup.\",\n",

Unfortunately, this means that at night, during games and practices, the parking lot is mostly full due to people parking there for their games.Do not let the parking lot fool you if there is a game in progress.

I uploaded that photo here at the time of this review but it was originally taken early in the year (mainly because I had another bad experience and I need to tell everyone not to come here any more because they suck.)So the first time, as the photo shows, a dead small black fly on the lettuce in my Classic Crispy Chicken Sandwich.

Why can\\'t the condiment be separate and not default? It\\'s so frustrating. Any way, 2nd time I got the sandwich, they \"got it right\" except for the fly part. I already went in my car so I said \"F it\" so I just took the picture as proof and then ripped the contaminated area on the lettuce.I didn\\'t go to this location for awhile after this incident, but I was craving Chicken McNuggets and so since it isn\\'t a fresh produce item or whatever, I decided it wouldn\\'t be a big deal. Boy was I wrong. I think this might have happened twice but I counted my nuggets and it was missing 1 in the 10 or 20 piece meal. I shouldn\\'t have to count how many nuggets I have, but sadly these people can\\'t do their job. I don\\'t even get much time to eat lunch so I didn\\'t have time to go back and complain. I\\'m done with this location any way so if I\\'m craving a sandwich or Chicken McNuggets from here, I\\'ll just drive across the bridge and go there because it probably isn\\'t crap like this location. They know they are serving a ton of people since they are the only location but they just do such a bad job. The fries are a bit overpriced too and some other things in case any of you were thinking you can get a decent deal on Large Fries.

       "  \"Located on the border of the West and Greenwich village, this McDonald's restaurant (which according to wikipedia is a part of the world's largest chain of hamburger fast food restaurants) is in a prime location.While the decor is a little dated, it reflects the some of the architecture and older buildings in the village. Î¾There is also a great hanging mural of basketball players located above the register and can be better viewed while dining on the second floor of the establishment (the art most likely drew inspiration from the West 4th street courts located across from the restaurant, paying homage to the locals).Instead of order from a waiter you order individually through the designated cash registers, while this may seem like more work it does save you some extra cash and also lets you customize your order directly without having to go through another person. Î¾The menu itself has it's staples, 'The Big Mac' , 'Filet-O-Fish', 'McNuggets' and of course the french fries which are all bargains for the amount of food you receive when compared to other restaurants. Î¾There is also an ever changing rotation of new sandwich, wraps, salads and other specialty items; all of which have the same McDonald's quality.This past visit I ordered a McDouble, a large french fires and a 4 piece McNuggets. Î¾The food was ready for me in under five minutes, a time almost unheard of at other restaurants. I took a seat at the upstairs section and started with the McDouble. The McDouble included two cooked beef patties, cheese, pickles, ketchup and chopped onions, very satisfying for under 2 dollars. Î¾I then switched between the hot crispy french fries and the McNuggets (small deep fried pieces of chicken) which I dipped in ketchup and their very tasty honey mustard sauce. Î¾All in all I was very full and content with my meal, all of which cost me under $10, at any other local restaurant just a burger and fries would have run me more than $10 and most likely closer to $15.Although the food may not be on par, quality wise with other nearby eateries (Minetta Tavern, 100 Acres and Market Table), essentially you are getting a full meal at nearly half the price and a quarter of the time.

There is also an assortment of good sandwich and pizza places around here.So why am I reviewing this McDonalds, you might ask. It is simple. 3rd avenue faces a lack of good places to sit and eat, especially on a hot day and if you are wearing clothes that you don't want to risk getting gyro sauce on. If you need somewhere to sit and eat, regardless of where you purchased your food, this McDonald's is the place to go. They have excellent air conditioning, a supply of good napkins, clean tables, and a nice view of the street.

       "  \"I mean, it's McDonald's. My expectations aren't very high. I just want two things: 1) My order right, and 2) not to be doused in scalding hot coffee.Yesterday I popped through the drive-thru here to grab a few things to munch on for the kiddos on the way to the store. It's easier for me to toss the kids in the car super early before breakfast and grab something on the way to beat the mobs. I ordered 3 sandwiches, 2 burritos, a coffee and a hashbrown. I get my receipt and I've only got 1 of everything listed. Grr. So I rectify it at the 2nd window, pay the difference, and have to pull up to the side and wait for the rest of the order. I park briefly to dole out the food, and no hashbrown :( The line at the drive-thru at this point was out of control and I wasn't about to unbuckle all 3 kids from their car seats to go in and fight over a $1 hashbrown. Whatever.This morning, I went through the drive-thru for a coffee after dropping dropping my kid off at school. The girl hands me my coffee with the lid half off, and of course, it's facing me. I'm doused in scalding hot coffee - all over my hands, legs, and of course, my brand new BlackBerry 9900 :\\\\ Î¾I look at her in shock, and tell her 'OMG you just spilled coffee all over me!' Her response, 'Que te paso?' and a blank stare. I hand the cup back to her, she fixes the lid, wipes it off, gives me an annoyed look and kinda waves me away. No apology, no nothing. Again, I realize this is McDonald's. But damn!\",\n",

Î¾We get there and there's about 4-5 people in the line before us and. by the time we order, maybe another 5-6 waiting BEHIND us. Î¾So we place our order with Roberto, who is only in charge of the orders and the register, he will not do anything else. Î¾We then proceed to wait for our food, we were hungry and in a rush so this was the easiest (and yes, unhealthy) option, or so we thought at the time. So we wait and wait and then wait some more and, in the meantime, the 5 people that came in AFTER us got their food and left...it's like HELLO!!!! WTF!!!! so hubby complains to Roberto who proceeds to explain that he only takes the order nothing else...duh! then Miguel, the manager, comes over, doesn't like the fact that hubby's obviously not happy with the situation and tells him it'll be another few minutes....w/e.Finally our food is ready and, guess what?!?!?!?!?! it was WRONG!!! WTF again!!! hubby goes back to the counter and now he is not nice at all and asks 'so how long will it take for me to get my correct order?' to which Miguel, the manager, turns around, gets hubby's correct order and exchanges it for the wrong one....HUH!?!?!?!?!?! amazing!!! By the time we get our food we are beyond hungry and in a not so nice mood. Oh well, at least I have to say that Miguel came to our table, when the rush was over to apologize for the incident and to offer us tomorrow's lunch for free, but we gratefully declined.\",\n",

They have so many different kinds of people, tourists, students, Î¾workers and of course plenty of street bums/crazies. Yet they seem to function seamlessly. I come here because I am hooked on their McCafees and recently Frappuccinos and occasional small fries. It just amazes me that such a busy location can function so nicely.

I do not stand in line more that 5 minutes and I am treated with a smile and because of this I took time out of my day to write this review for them as a thank you!\",\n",

Î¾It\\'s McDonalds you say, what do you expect? Î¾Not much, really but let me tell you...ENCOUNTER #1I ordered 10-piece chicken nuggets, fries, and unsweetened ice tea. Î¾I got the nuggets and tea. Î¾I went up to the counter, placed my receipt on the counter gently faced away from me, and said \"I\\'m sorry, I --\" Î¾Before I finished my sentence, the employee SLAMMED her hand on my receipt on the counter and dragged it towards her. Î¾Um... WTF?!I didn\\'t know how to react because she looked at my receipt and threw it away without addressing me. Î¾I went \"um...ok...\" and backed away from the counter to fill my tea. Î¾I have no clue what I did to piss this employee off but my friend who came with me, asked me what the heck happened. Î¾I said \"I have no clue, I\\'m just missing my fries...\" Î¾My friend was nice and *itchy enough to go up to the counter, grab the attention of a different employee and told him we were missing our fries.But honestly, what is wrong with you? Î¾I\\'m SORRY you were having a bad day but that doesn\\'t excuse you from taking it out on a customer who was trying to be nice about an honest mistake that can be easily fixed. Î¾Not a big deal, I paid for fries and I have an incomplete order. Î¾So chill, geez.---------ENCOUNTER #23 friends and I came here for smoothies. Î¾One of my friends ordered a big mac, nuggets and fries. Î¾Everyone else got our orders. Î¾My friend waited 20 minutes for his order to be done. Î¾No lie, we looked at the time on the receipt.You\\'re thinking, um yea maybe they were cooking it. Î¾No...In that 20 minutes, we saw 5 employees goofing off, bickering with each other, throwing towels at each other, and basically... being extremely unprofessional. Î¾They didn\\'t even do this in the back were customers cant see, they did this all in front of us, just on the other side of the counter. Î¾Based on the manager\\'s asking where the order is, they seem to have forgotten about the order.I don\\'t care if you do this at work, but can you do this when no one is waiting for their food? Î¾It\\'s really awkward to be standing and waiting while watching you goof off AND have your manager ask the team where our order is... THREE times.I really felt embarrassed for the manager because this just reflects badly on him but he really should be more assertive and keep his team in check. Î¾For his credit, he did give us a coupon for a free dessert of our choice...which honestly is nothing because I dont ever order a pie, cone, or sundae.oh and our smoothies were not filled all the way to the top... Î¾mine was 75% full.',\n",
       "  \"Okay so I came in here yesterday around 4:15 P.M. I took a while trying to make up my mind. Î¾I had seen a commercial about the mozzarella sticks. SO I thought I would try that, a Î¾McDouble and a medium French fries. When I ordered I started with the mozzarella sticks. Î¾The cashier thought I said chicken McNuggets. Î¾I corrected her and said the mozzarella sticks. Î¾Then I also ordered the McDouble and the medium French fries. Î¾My order was rung up and I got my order withing 5 minutes. That's good. Î¾Bad- I can't for the life of me find where the salt, pepper and ketchup is on the first floor. If they have it on the second floor I don't remember. I was in a rush to get home so I grabbed my food and went to wait for the subway. I looked in the bag and was surprised at what I saw. Î¾In my bag was a medium order of French fries, 4 chicken McNuggets, a McDouble, and a pack of marinara sauce. Î¾I used the marinara sauce for the chicken. However, in what language does mozzarella sticks sound like chicken McNuggets? Î¾And I wonder what the price difference was between the mozzarella sticks and 4 piece chicken McNuggets.I already swiped my Metrocard so it wasn't worth it to complain.\",\n",
       "  \"When I am really craving for McDonald's, this seems to be the closest. But I'm no big fan of fast food chains.I don't like this location just because there are bums inside waiting for the bus to go to Atlantic City or whatever...they usually sit and chat and drink some coffee.

       "  'Two points right out of the gate: 1. Thuggery knows no race (lily white frat boys from the suburbs can be just as vulgar and aggressive as any group with a gang mentality) 2. Rating a McDonald\\'s and McDonald\\'s food isn\\'t really an essential service; people generally know what they\\'re getting - menu and quality wise - going in. The purpose of this review is mostly about the safety factor. People need to know (and I think locals already do) that, depending on the time of day (night), this place is marginally dangerous. Over my last three visits to Chicago, I\\'ve noticed this neighborhood being overrun by flash mobs who do more looting, aggressive panhandling, and fighting than choreographed performing. In fact, this particular McDonald\\'s had to be closed down for several hours a couple months ago while police attempted to restore order. The Water Tower Place Mall about a block away has seen an increase in gang activity lately, including the arrest of some armed teenagers. This isn\\'t just my take (check out some of the other reviews of this place and this neighborhood). Many are pointing out that the Mag Mile is slowly becoming the \"Mug Mile.\" And this McDonald\\'s seems to be ground zero for Hip Hop Nation as they pour off the Red Line after taking up two seats on the subway while grandma has to stand. Apologists and the agenda driven will say (and have said): \"These kids are guilty of nothing other than being black in a predominantly white neighborhood.\" Really? Since when does being authentically \"black\" include screaming nonstop obscenities with little kids around (black and white)? Since when did Chicago get so soft on youth crime? Since when did it become open season on civility? [Since when did my reviews start reading like the rantings of some terrified reactionary/fascist?] While it\\'s mildly funny that Katelyn, Emily, Ashley, and their dolly buying mommies must sometimes contend with this thuggery after they leave the American Girl Doll store, nobody (not even the over-privileged, country club set) should have to endure this genuinely menacing behavior. And youth thugs (of any race) should NOT be permitted to turn this area into the \"Wild mid-West.\" Just a thought, Rahm - do what you want with it.']}"
